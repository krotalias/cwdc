00:00:19.812 --> 00:00:22.374
[President Franklin Roosevelt]
The political situation in the world

2
00:00:22.398 --> 00:00:27.110
has now reached a stage
where the very foundations of civilization

3
00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:29.153
are seriously threatened.

4
00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:31.948
- [crowd clamoring]
- War is a contagion.

5
00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.533
The peace of the world,

6
00:00:33.617 --> 00:00:36.452
the welfare and security of every nation,

7
00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:40.498
including our own,
is being threatened by that very thing.

8
00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:44.293
Let no one imagine
that America will escape.

9
00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:48.715
Yes, we are determined to keep out of war.

10
00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:51.426
Yet we cannot insure ourselves

11
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.095
against the disastrous effects of war,

12
00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.305
and the dangers of involvement.

13
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.015
[voice echoes]

14
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.780
[duck quacks]

15
00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.792
[ducks quacking]

16
00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:07.543
[chuckles]

17
00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:10.046
This is bloody ridiculous.

18
00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:14.258
Wasn't your empire built
on ridiculous traditions?

19
00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:15.885
Don't defend them, Layton.

20
00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.678
You might speak their language,

21
00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:19.555
but they still think you're a barbarian.

22
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.265
Be honest.

23
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.351
You won't miss this place
when you're gone?

24
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:27.855
[Rawlings] Oh, please.
The next time I see the little buggers,

25
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.108
I hope it's through the sights
of a 14-inch gun.

26
00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:32.193
[ducks quacking]

27
00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.572
[speaking Japanese]

28
00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:41.953
[Rawlings] Gentlemen.
On behalf of the British Empire,

29
00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:45.873
I wish to thank Admiral Yamamoto
for this invitation.

30
00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:51.128
May our nations work together
to maintain peace on the seas.

31
00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:06.435
[Yamamoto speaking Japanese]

32
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.568
[speaking Japanese]

33
00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:43.306
[in English] Which is why I know
that you must have an opinion.

34
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.517
I was once our naval attachÃ©
in Washington.

35
00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:48.686
After you went to Harvard.

36
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.647
Like you, I thought there was value

37
00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:54.734
in studying a potential adversary.

38
00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.903
There's a rumor
that you told the prime minister

39
00:03:56.987 --> 00:03:59.488
that Japan can't win a war
with the United States.

40
00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:02.366
I said we couldn't win a long war.

41
00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:05.828
There's another rumor
that your life is in danger.

42
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.248
[sighs] That the nationalists
think you're too moderate

43
00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:10.933
and have targeted you for assassination.

44
00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.639
Japan is at a crossroads.

45
00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:28.684
We are emboldened by our invasion of China

46
00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:31.145
and eager to become a world power.

47
00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:35.524
Yet we get 80% of our oil
from your country.

48
00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.862
If that supply is threatened...

49
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.283
it will force us into drastic measures.

50
00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:49.538
You want me to pass this information
along to Washington?

51
00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:52.208
Don't push us into a corner.

52
00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:56.170
You must give those of us
who are more reasonable

53
00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.506
a chance to carry the day.

54
00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:02.218
Nobody wants a war.

55
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.352
Sayonara.

56
00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.145
[speaks Japanese]

57
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.980
Sayonara.

58
00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:03.404
[men shouting, indistinct]

59
00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:26.135
[training officer]
Come on. Step it up, ladies!

60
00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:29.138
Clear the flight deck. Let's go.

61
00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:39.899
Prepare to brace!

62
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.281
Why aren't you using the flaps, sir?

63
00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:50.659
Because someday we might have to land
with our flaps shot away.

64
00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:52.912
So we might as well practice now.

65
00:06:56.792 --> 00:06:59.126
This isn't how Ensign Hunt used to fly.

66
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:02.713
Which is why Ensign Hunt
is now counting seagulls in San Diego,

67
00:07:02.798 --> 00:07:04.215
and you're here with me.

68
00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.760
Looks like we got hit
in our fuel tank too.

69
00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.428
Please don't, sir.

70
00:07:09.513 --> 00:07:12.014
This might save your life one day, Murray.

71
00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.766
Engine's about to die.

72
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.684
[engine turns off]

73
00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:20.064
[man on speakers]
Stand by to recover aircraft.

74
00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:22.775
[McClusky] What the hell is Best doing?
He's out of the groove.

75
00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.902
It looks like his engine cut out.

76
00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:26.821
Is it a stunt or is he in trouble?

77
00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:28.405
I don't know.

78
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.908
But he's going to hit
the first wire like always.

79
00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:32.034
Not with that angle.

80
00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:37.248
Why are we sideways?

81
00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:40.584
To shave speed
so we don't put a hole in the deck.

82
00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.461
Better not crash that damn plane.

83
00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.590
Hey, hang in there, kid.
We're almost home.

84
00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:56.141
Brace!

85
00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.727
[grunts]

86
00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:03.274
[metal rattles]

87
00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:05.484
[chattering, indistinct]

88
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.586
Are you trying to get court-martialed?

89
00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:25.462
I had electrical issue.

90
00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:28.382
Could have happened to anyone.

91
00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.010
Hey! Good job.

92
00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.139
It's not me you have to convince.

93
00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:37.516
McClusky's about ready to have your ass.

94
00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:40.603
Then I'll take it upstairs to the old man.
He knows what's coming.

95
00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:43.448
That's why we've been flying
double scouting missions this whole trip.

96
00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:47.067
[alarm blaring]

97
00:08:49.321 --> 00:08:52.031
[chattering, indistinct]

98
00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:55.492
Going somewhere?

99
00:08:56.328 --> 00:08:59.079
Yeah. They're sending the whole squadron
into Pearl this morning.

100
00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:02.625
And I'll be drinking a beer on the beach
with Roy by noon.

101
00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:03.751
And I'm not coming?

102
00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:06.253
No. McClusky's holding back Scouting Six.

103
00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:08.631
It's probably 'cause
you're such an asshole.

104
00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.467
Yeah. You're lovin' this, right?

105
00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:14.094
Morning, sir. Aircraft is spotted.

106
00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:17.556
Hey, take it easy on Miller.
He's having a tough morning.

107
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.975
It's my last day of sea duty, sir,

108
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.420
and I'm the only one from my radio class
who hasn't crashed.

109
00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:24.146
Don't worry, Miller.

110
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.148
I'm sure even Mr. Dickinson can fly you

111
00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.317
from here to Pearl
without getting you wet.

112
00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:30.694
Hey. Me and Roy,

113
00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.072
we'll pour a little beer
out on the beach for ya.

114
00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.345
[Pearce] Well, you boys
are taking your sweet time.

115
00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.055
Chaplain's gonna be here any minute.

116
00:09:58.974 --> 00:10:00.432
It's another hot one, sir.

117
00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:03.143
- Are you complaining, Sully?
- No, sir.

118
00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:06.605
I just can't help wondering
why I have to set up chairs for church,

119
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.565
even though I don't believe in God.

120
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:12.695
Well, that's because
your only religion is chasing tail.

121
00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.419
And the Navy ain't gonna pay you for that.

122
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.285
[airplane engines whirring]

123
00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.707
[gunfire]

124
00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:32.589
Incoming!

125
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.057
[engines whirring continues]

126
00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:44.560
[guns firing]

127
00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:53.610
[explosion]

128
00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.654
[Ann] Barbara!

129
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.407
Barbara!

130
00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:02.453
Barbara, come here!

131
00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.164
Come on, sweetheart.

132
00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:06.957
[airplanes approaching]

133
00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:21.805
Get the wounded below deck!
Everyone else, battle stations!

134
00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.850
[panting]

135
00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:37.821
[projectile whistling]

136
00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:39.239
- [explosion]
- Get down!

137
00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:48.832
[Dagne] Comin' to church?

138
00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:51.168
[Edwin] I have to go to the office.

139
00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:52.503
It's Sunday.

140
00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:55.714
You work too hard.

141
00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:58.342
[phone ringing]

142
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.558
Layton residence.

143
00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:09.269
[air raid siren blaring]

144
00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:10.604
I'll meet you outside.

145
00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:14.274
- Edwin, what's happening?
- The Japanese are attacking us.

146
00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:19.530
- [Crosley] Did you reach the office?
- No. The switchboard was jammed.

147
00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:22.032
- [siren continues]
- Go.

148
00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:34.086
- [Pearce] Sully, get up! Come on!
- [grunts]

149
00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:37.149
We need to get to the gun directors.

150
00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.924
They're firing way too low.

151
00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.594
[projectile whistling]

152
00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:47.349
Take cover! Get down!

153
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.314
[tires screech]

154
00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:05.075
Drive!

155
00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:11.456
- Hey. Are you okay?
- [groans]

156
00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:18.213
[groans]

157
00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:20.424
[man screaming]

158
00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:23.468
[screaming continues]

159
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.598
[metal creaking]

160
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.019
[Pearce] We have to get off the ship.
Come on.

161
00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:33.520
Hurry up, kid.

162
00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:36.648
[Brown] We gotta jump.

163
00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.093
You go in that water, you're dead.

164
00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:44.865
Sully! You first, Sully.

165
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.241
I can't! My hands...

166
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.285
You wanna live?

167
00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:50.537
You get to that goddamn ship, you hear me?

168
00:13:58.087 --> 00:13:59.755
[gunfire, explosions]

169
00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.425
What is it, sir?

170
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:06.261
Looks like Coastal Artillery
went stark mad.

171
00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.513
I bet you
somebody's gonna catch hell for it.

172
00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:10.682
[gunfire]

173
00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:12.184
Incoming!

174
00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:18.732
Miller, break radio silence!
Get that gun working!

175
00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:21.151
Pearl is under attack. This is no shit.

176
00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:35.165
Miller, you okay?

177
00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:39.211
[grunts]

178
00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:40.337
Miller, bail out!

179
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:44.925
[grunts]

180
00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:50.430
Miller! Miller!

181
00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:51.765
Miller!

182
00:14:58.189 --> 00:15:01.191
- [Dick] What the hell is going on?
- Pearl is shooting at our guys, sir.

183
00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:03.610
Then maybe it isn't Pearl.
Look, call Dickinson.

184
00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:06.697
We had a transmission that
he was under attack, and then nothing.

185
00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:11.076
Sir.

186
00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:15.247
Get this to the Admiral.

187
00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:24.840
[screams]

188
00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:31.722
Keep going, Sully!

189
00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:35.434
[whimpers]

190
00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:36.601
[grunts]

191
00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:41.440
[man] Run! Hurry up!

192
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:46.653
Get down!

193
00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:55.579
[chattering, indistinct]

194
00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:57.247
Oh, come on.

195
00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:02.294
There's the man who tried to warn us.

196
00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:04.921
If it's any satisfaction to you, Layton,
you were right.

197
00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:08.050
Sir, it's no satisfaction
to me whatsoever.

198
00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:09.468
[explosion]

199
00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:21.980
You bastard.

200
00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:23.315
[grunts]

201
00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:28.487
[screams]

202
00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.202
[grunts]

203
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:36.995

[pants]

205
00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:54.763
- Sir, where are they going?
- [Edwin] Back to their carriers.

206
00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:57.849
Drive out to the radio direction finder
and report back to me.

207
00:16:57.934 --> 00:16:59.101
Yes, sir.

208
00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:01.978
[chattering, indistinct]

209
00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:07.859
[sailor] Admiral Halsey on deck.

210
00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:11.530
Pearl found something?

211
00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:14.783
Intelligence managed to get
a line of bearing on the attacking fleet.

212
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.285
But it's a bilateral reading.

213
00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:21.790
The Japanese are either at 343 degrees

214
00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:23.542
or 163 degrees.

215
00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:24.876
Oh, for Christ's sake.

216
00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:27.129
Pearl is under attack
and we don't even know

217
00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:29.047
if the bastards are north or south?

218
00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:32.217
Army bombers also reported
a possible ship sighting here.

219
00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:35.429
We're gonna place our bet...

220
00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:37.597
right there.

221
00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:40.892
[McClusky] We have a possible location
on the Jap fleet.

222
00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:43.061
Fly a grid on bearing 185.

223
00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:46.189
If you make contact, Best and his men
will put down a smoke screen,

224
00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:48.442
and then the torpedo bombers
will make their runs.

225
00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:49.985
Lindsey has command.

226
00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:52.070
Uh, to hell with smoke.

227
00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:54.656
Let me go after those carriers
with a real bomb.

228
00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.826
Torpedoes sink ships, not bombs,
and my men need a screen.

229
00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.347
[Dick] Even if you get close enough,
your torpedoes don't work.

230
00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:01.765
- That's a rumor.
- Yeah, it's a rumor,

231
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:03.874
'cause the damn things
have never been tested.

232
00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.626
Look, the Japs are out there
killing our friends.

233
00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:10.130
Let me put a 500-pound bomb
right down their goddamn smokestack.

234
00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:13.508
We're not changing tactics
just because you want revenge.

235
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.646
[Murray] Going after the Japs, sir?

236
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:28.482
Yeah, we're gonna smoke 'em to death.

237
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:55.509
[Edwin] Japanese are attacking
on multiple fronts.

238
00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:57.886
We captured a radio log
from a downed Japanese plane.

239
00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.930
They hit us with all six
of their fleet carriers.

240
00:19:00.723 --> 00:19:02.849
At least they didn't destroy
our oil tanks.

241
00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:05.268
The whole fleet would've had to withdraw
to the West Coast.

242
00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.772
You are the best intelligence officer
I've ever known, Layton.

243
00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:10.857
They'll probably burn you for this too.

244
00:19:11.442 --> 00:19:12.817
But if they don't,

245
00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:15.028
swear to me

246
00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:17.864
you'll make the next man in this chair
listen to you.

247
00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:20.534
[airplane engines whirring]

248
00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:24.329
See anything, sir?

249
00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:26.331
Not even a goddamn whale.

250
00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:36.967
Six Baker 10, this is Six Torpedo One.

251
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:38.760
Lead us back to Enterprise.

252
00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.929
Six Torpedo One,
your pilots aren't trained

253
00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.139
for a night carrier landing
with live ordnance.

254
00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:44.849
Go land at Pearl.

255
00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:48.186
We can't clear the mountains.
Take us back to Enterprise, Lieutenant.

256
00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:49.604
That's an order.

257
00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:54.067
Six Torpedo One, I'm dropping my
smoke tanks and returning to Enterprise.

258
00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:55.485
Follow me if you want.

259
00:20:11.294 --> 00:20:13.295
[chattering, indistinct]

260
00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.215
We got word from Pearl.

261
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.884
The Jap fleet was north, not south.

262
00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:22.387
Goddamn it!

263
00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:32.063
[screams]

264
00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:35.900
[cheers]

265
00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.360
[applause]

266
00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:39.696
Good job, man!

267
00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:44.492
[Dick] Hey, Lindsey,
this is what I was afraid of.

268
00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:46.620
One of your men almost blows up
the damn carrier,

269
00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:49.205
because you were too afraid
to get shot down flying into Pearl.

270
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:53.209
Do I have to remind you that I am
your superior officer, Lieutenant?

271
00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:55.754
- You gonna hide behind your rank?
- Save it for the Japs.

272
00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:58.632
We're at war now, McClusky.
When that guy screws up, people die!

273
00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:01.468
Listen to me. You wanna keep flying?

274
00:21:01.552 --> 00:21:04.179
I suggest you knock off
the cowboy bullshit.

275
00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:06.765
[Dick] Come on, Murray.

276
00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:30.955
Jesus.

277
00:21:33.084 --> 00:21:34.292
What are they doing?

278
00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:39.506
When she went over, everyone below deck
was probably trapped inside.

279
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:46.388
[Murray] Did you know
anyone aboard Arizona?

280
00:21:47.682 --> 00:21:48.890
[Dick] Yeah.

281
00:21:50.184 --> 00:21:52.143
My roommate from the academy.

282
00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:54.729
Lieutenant Roy Pearce.

283
00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:10.328
I heard you jumped out
of a perfectly good plane.

284
00:22:10.413 --> 00:22:13.164
Well, it was on fire.
And the controls were dead.

285
00:22:14.709 --> 00:22:15.792
Where's Miller?

286
00:22:18.504 --> 00:22:19.838
Oh, hell.

287
00:22:20.715 --> 00:22:21.965
Yeah.

288
00:22:22.425 --> 00:22:23.842
Hey, Ann's by the gate.

289
00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:26.761
Are you okay?

290
00:22:27.555 --> 00:22:28.888
Yeah, I'm all right.

291
00:22:31.934 --> 00:22:33.184
- Hi.
- Hey.

292
00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:36.563
- Come home tonight.
- I wish.

293
00:22:36.647 --> 00:22:38.565
We sail as soon as we're refueled.

294
00:22:39.275 --> 00:22:42.193
Look, I want you and Barb to go back
to your parents' place in Jersey.

295
00:22:42.278 --> 00:22:44.446
- No.
- It's not safe here.

296
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.698
Everyone is saying
this is gonna be a long war.

297
00:22:46.782 --> 00:22:49.033
- What if...
- You're not shipping us off to Jersey.

298
00:22:49.118 --> 00:22:50.201
And that's final.

299
00:22:52.163 --> 00:22:53.496
Did you talk to Sarah?

300
00:22:54.874 --> 00:22:56.332
Was Roy aboard the Arizona?

301
00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.668
Yes.

302
00:23:01.672 --> 00:23:04.090
We're checking all the hospitals,
but nothing yet.

303
00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:08.595
Tell her I'll find him.

304
00:23:16.896 --> 00:23:17.979
Thank you.

305
00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:19.773
Hey.

306
00:23:22.943 --> 00:23:26.070
I heard you were with Lieutenant Pearce
during the attack.

307
00:23:32.369 --> 00:23:33.495
Sully...

308
00:23:34.747 --> 00:23:36.080
what happened to him?

309
00:23:38.626 --> 00:23:39.959
I don't know.

310
00:23:40.044 --> 00:23:42.712
[sniffles] I don't know.

311
00:23:57.228 --> 00:24:01.689
We're doing our best, but they've been
bringing body parts in pillowcases.

312
00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:04.108
There's too many.

313
00:24:07.321 --> 00:24:08.571
He was a blond guy.

314
00:24:08.656 --> 00:24:11.074
Tall. Probably wearing
an officer's uniform.

315
00:24:11.617 --> 00:24:12.951
Officers are down here.

316
00:24:18.249 --> 00:24:20.917
Is there anything else you can give me?

317
00:24:21.001 --> 00:24:22.752
Identifying features? Tattoos?

318
00:24:23.546 --> 00:24:28.383
Well, he would've been wearing
our class ring from Annapolis.

319
00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:43.815
[sighs]

320
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:50.613
We, uh...

321
00:24:50.698 --> 00:24:53.032
took this off the body when he came in.

322
00:25:01.208 --> 00:25:02.292
I'm sorry.

323
00:25:03.002 --> 00:25:04.168
I'll give you a moment.

[President Franklin Roosevelt]
December 7, 1941...

325

a date which will live in infamy.

326
00:25:21.896 --> 00:25:26.733
The United States of America
was suddenly and deliberately attacked

327
00:25:26.817 --> 00:25:32.030
by naval and air forces
of the Empire of Japan.

328
00:25:32.114 --> 00:25:35.658
The United States was at peace
with that nation...

329
00:25:36.535 --> 00:25:38.703
and, at the solicitation...

335
00:27:36.155 --> 00:27:37.697
[Nimitz] Congratulations, sir.

336
00:27:37.781 --> 00:27:39.699
You're the right man to run the Navy.

337
00:27:41.368 --> 00:27:44.370
When they get in trouble,
they send for the sons of bitches.

340
00:28:12.608 --> 00:28:15.526
The situation in the Pacific

341
00:28:15.611 --> 00:28:17.945
is far worse than has been reported.

342
00:28:18.614 --> 00:28:21.699
We have three carriers. The Japs have ten.

343
00:28:21.784 --> 00:28:24.702
We have zero functional battleships,
they have nine.

344
00:28:25.454 --> 00:28:28.623
They have more cruisers,
more bombers, more fighters, and...

345
00:28:29.583 --> 00:28:31.626
much of their equipment is more modern.

346
00:28:32.503 --> 00:28:35.213
We'll just have to count on the men
that we have out there to...

347
00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.757
hold the line.

348
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.384
I don't envy the new commander.

349
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.227
It's me, isn't it?

350
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.856
The President asked for you himself.

to Pearl and stay there...

357
00:29:46.743 --> 00:29:48.744
[seagulls squawking]

358
00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:51.706
[officer] A-ten-hut!

359
00:29:55.002 --> 00:29:56.085
Ready.

360
00:29:56.753 --> 00:29:57.837
Aim.

361
00:29:57.921 --> 00:29:59.005
Fire.

362
00:29:59.882 --> 00:30:01.382
Aim.

363
00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:02.592
- Fire.
- [guns fire]

364
00:30:02.676 --> 00:30:03.759
I'll be right back.

365
00:30:05.304 --> 00:30:06.721
- Fire.
- [guns fire]

366
00:30:11.101 --> 00:30:12.435
I'm so sorry.

367
00:30:13.395 --> 00:30:15.563
Roy wanted to be a pilot like you.

368
00:30:16.815 --> 00:30:18.524
But I talked him out of it.

369
00:30:18.609 --> 00:30:20.526
I said it was too dangerous.

370
00:30:24.114 --> 00:30:26.782
- I'll see you at the next funeral.
- You don't have to go.

371
00:30:26.867 --> 00:30:28.034
Yes, I do.

372
00:30:29.369 --> 00:30:30.661
We're family.

373
00:30:34.041 --> 00:30:35.561
- [pounds table]
- [Gay] Hey, hey, hey!

374
00:30:36.168 --> 00:30:39.837
I just wanna say, Roy Pearce
was one of the finest bastards

375
00:30:39.922 --> 00:30:41.297
that I've ever met.

376
00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:43.299
And I could talk about the man
for an hour.

377
00:30:43.383 --> 00:30:45.278
But I think that's a job I'll leave up
to one of you boys

378
00:30:45.302 --> 00:30:46.662
that went to the academy with him.

379
00:30:48.221 --> 00:30:49.555
What do you say?

380
00:30:50.098 --> 00:30:53.142
Yeah, well, I can't let some
torpedo jockey speak for Roy.

381
00:30:53.226 --> 00:30:55.561
Especially one not good enough
to fly from Enterprise.

382
00:30:55.646 --> 00:30:57.897
- [all] Oh!
- Okay.

383
00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:05.321
Summer after plebe year,

384
00:31:05.405 --> 00:31:09.450
me, Roy and Dickie went up to visit
Roy's uncle up in the Great Lakes.

385
00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:12.703
It was the peak of Prohibition,
so one night we decide to sail to Canada

386
00:31:12.788 --> 00:31:14.163
to buy a keg of beer.

387
00:31:14.247 --> 00:31:16.666
On our way back,
right before the sun comes up,

388
00:31:17.417 --> 00:31:18.793
the wind dies.

389
00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:22.630
So, there we are,
just floating in the middle of the lake,

390
00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:25.466
waiting for the Border Patrol to show up.

391
00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.677
I said we should just ditch the booze,
but Roy...

392
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.222
Hey, Dickie. What did Roy say?

393
00:31:31.306 --> 00:31:34.308
"Hell, no. We'll drink it all."

394
00:31:34.393 --> 00:31:35.893
[laughter]

395
00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:41.315
Roy was my best man.

396
00:31:44.361 --> 00:31:46.487
He was the godfather to my daughter.

397
00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:49.156
I thought someday...

398
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:52.076
we'd be on a porch, drinking beers,

399
00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.745
telling lies about what we did
in the big war.

400
00:32:00.961 --> 00:32:02.294
[glasses clinking]

401
00:32:02.379 --> 00:32:04.797
- To Roy.
- To Roy.

402
00:32:04.881 --> 00:32:06.340
[all] To Roy.

403
00:32:09.261 --> 00:32:12.054
[Dickinson] Man, oh, man.
Why'd you make me drink so much?

404
00:32:12.139 --> 00:32:14.765
- You might have to carry me home, darling.
- [horn honks]

405
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.059
Oh, shit. Shore Patrol.

406
00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:20.021
No, that's the Admiral's flag.

407
00:32:20.647 --> 00:32:22.231
Hey, I bet it's the new commander.

408
00:32:22.315 --> 00:32:24.984
- Who do you think it is?
- That looks like Nimitz.

409
00:32:25.068 --> 00:32:26.819
I hear he's true-blue.

410
00:32:26.903 --> 00:32:28.070
Hey, Nimitz!

411
00:32:28.155 --> 00:32:30.114
When are you going to let us
at those Japs?

412
00:32:30.991 --> 00:32:32.199
I'm sorry, sir. [sighs]

413
00:32:32.284 --> 00:32:33.826
Do you want me to get their names?

414
00:32:34.369 --> 00:32:35.369
No.

415
00:32:35.454 --> 00:32:37.913
- I think he might have heard you.
- [both laugh]

416
00:32:37.998 --> 00:32:41.250
I'm glad at least some of the boys
still want to fight.

417
00:32:54.765 --> 00:32:55.973
[knocks on door]

418
00:32:56.058 --> 00:32:57.391
[Edwin] Welcome to Pearl, sir.

419
00:32:57.476 --> 00:32:59.101
I'm Lieutenant Commander Layton.

420
00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:01.395
I know who you are.

421
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.731
Well, then you'll understand my request.

422
00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:05.816
I wish to be reassigned to a destroyer.

423
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:10.654
Didn't you try to warn my predecessor
about the impending attack?

424
00:33:10.739 --> 00:33:11.739
Well, not exactly.

425
00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:14.992
I said that we had lost track
of the enemy carriers

426
00:33:15.077 --> 00:33:16.494
and needed to be prepared.

427
00:33:17.704 --> 00:33:19.038
I should've pushed harder.

428
00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.541
A lesson, I assume,

429
00:33:22.626 --> 00:33:24.251
you have taken to heart.

430
00:33:24.336 --> 00:33:28.255
Sir, I'm the intelligence officer
responsible for overseeing

431
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:32.009
the greatest intelligence failure
in American history.

432
00:33:33.095 --> 00:33:34.095
Close the door.

433
00:33:37.099 --> 00:33:40.309
Morale is at an all-time low,
and for good reason.

434
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.898
The Japanese are advancing on all fronts
at a terrifying pace.

435
00:33:45.982 --> 00:33:50.152
I nevertheless know
the fighting spirit of our men.

436
00:33:51.196 --> 00:33:53.072
And I have faith in them.

437
00:33:53.156 --> 00:33:56.450
But I also need to know

438
00:33:56.535 --> 00:33:58.536
that they have faith in themselves.

439
00:33:59.663 --> 00:34:01.789
I need you to be my Admiral Yamamoto.

440
00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:04.625
Get in his head.
Tell me what he's gonna do next.

441
00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:06.210
Your first assignment:

442
00:34:06.294 --> 00:34:08.337
we need to throw a punch.

443
00:34:08.421 --> 00:34:09.630
Not just for morale,

444
00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:13.676
but so the Japanese know
what it feels like to be hit.

445
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.179
I'm sending Halsey to attack
the Marshall Islands.

446
00:34:17.264 --> 00:34:20.432
But I need to know
that they're not walking into a trap.

447
00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:32.486
[officer] The target is Roi Island.

448
00:34:32.571 --> 00:34:35.489
Our submarines have reported
shipping traffic

449
00:34:35.574 --> 00:34:37.324
and one military airfield.

450
00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:40.202
We don't know what we're facing,
so hit 'em as hard as possible

451
00:34:40.287 --> 00:34:41.704
and then get the hell out.

452
00:34:41.788 --> 00:34:43.998
So what about the enemy carrier?

453
00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:46.083
Intelligence says
they're 2,000 miles away.

454
00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:47.710
You mean the same group of geniuses

455
00:34:47.794 --> 00:34:49.674
who didn't know the Japs
were gunning for Pearl?

456
00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:52.423
Like I said, be prepared for anything.

457
00:34:53.133 --> 00:34:54.466
[chattering, indistinct]

458
00:34:56.428 --> 00:34:59.722
[Lindsey] The early bird
catches the worm, gentlemen.

459
00:34:59.806 --> 00:35:03.434
We're gonna hit that anchorage before
the Japs have even rolled out of bed.

460
00:35:03.518 --> 00:35:05.936
Looks like he spit-polished his shoes.

461
00:35:06.688 --> 00:35:09.023
Hey, guys. Let's get home in one piece.

462
00:35:09.107 --> 00:35:10.608
[Dickinson] Oh, don't you worry.

463
00:35:12.819 --> 00:35:13.944
What's the plan, sir?

464
00:35:14.029 --> 00:35:16.155
The other squadrons will strike first.

465
00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:18.782
Then we go in and clean up
the remaining targets.

466
00:35:18.867 --> 00:35:20.367
The Japs will know we're coming.

467
00:35:20.452 --> 00:35:21.952
What happens if we get shot down?

468
00:35:22.037 --> 00:35:24.413
Look, I'm not gonna end up as a POW.

469
00:35:24.497 --> 00:35:26.040
And neither are you.

470
00:35:34.424 --> 00:35:37.593
I've got a large target in my sight.
Get close enough to make it count.

471
00:35:39.179 --> 00:35:40.846
[shouting in Japanese]

472
00:35:44.643 --> 00:35:46.852
Start your runs, boys. Engage torpedoes.

473
00:36:05.372 --> 00:36:06.372
[screams]

474
00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.679
Looks like our boys on Roi
poked a hornet's nest.

475
00:36:27.852 --> 00:36:28.936
We got a problem.

476
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:32.356
I got eyes on a second enemy airfield
on Taroa Island.

477
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:35.067
I'm counting maybe 30 bombers
and heavy fighter cover.

478
00:36:36.277 --> 00:36:37.319
You hear that, boys?

479
00:36:37.404 --> 00:36:41.031
If we don't knock out that airfield,
they'll go after Enterprise.

480
00:36:41.116 --> 00:36:43.701
And I want a place to land
when this is over.

481
00:36:55.714 --> 00:36:56.714
[gunfire]

482
00:36:58.216 --> 00:36:59.842
Enemy fighters, 11:00!

483
00:36:59.926 --> 00:37:01.844
We got company. Start your runs!

484
00:37:27.454 --> 00:37:28.746
Three thousand!

485
00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:38.047
Two thousand!

486
00:37:38.131 --> 00:37:39.590
Nineteen hundred!

487
00:37:39.674 --> 00:37:41.216
Eighteen hundred!

488
00:37:41.301 --> 00:37:42.634
Sixteen hundred!

489
00:38:21.758 --> 00:38:24.218
Get those bastards off me, Murray!

490
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.825
[sighs]

491
00:39:29.909 --> 00:39:31.660
[Dick] Let's get out of here, Murray.

492
00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:42.296
We got most of the bombers,
but not all of them.

493
00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.298
Looks like they almost got you.

494
00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:45.632
Yeah, not enough lead.

495
00:39:49.637 --> 00:39:50.971
What, too much excitement for ya?

496
00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:53.015
I'm not looking to win a medal.

497
00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:56.787
[Dickinson] You know, the Navy's gonna
make you pay for this aircraft.

498
00:39:56.811 --> 00:39:58.187
How'd you boys do?

499
00:39:58.271 --> 00:39:59.938
We lost Hopping.

500
00:40:01.191 --> 00:40:02.816
He never pulled out of his dive.

501
00:40:02.901 --> 00:40:05.402
[alarm blaring]

502
00:40:05.486 --> 00:40:06.904
That can't be good.

503
00:40:06.988 --> 00:40:08.614
[man on PA, indistinct]

504
00:40:11.993 --> 00:40:13.952
[Halsey] Twin-engine bombers, 5:00.

505
00:40:27.175 --> 00:40:30.886
Goddamn gunners. Don't they know
they gotta lead those planes?

506
00:40:37.435 --> 00:40:39.311
- Right standard rudder.
- [Browning] Brace!

507
00:40:43.942 --> 00:40:45.943
Brace for impact!

508
00:41:06.047 --> 00:41:07.965
What the hell is he doing?

509
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.426
He's turning himself into a bomb.

510
00:41:30.238 --> 00:41:31.321
Come on!

511
00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:34.574
[screams]

512
00:41:45.962 --> 00:41:47.963
[men cheering]

513
00:41:54.012 --> 00:41:56.680
- Damn, Bruno.
- Aren't they paying us to kill Japs?

514
00:41:58.599 --> 00:41:59.879
Admiral Halsey wants to see you.

515
00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:11.278
[sighs]

516
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.781
That's the bravest damn thing
I think I've ever seen.

517
00:42:16.034 --> 00:42:18.785
- What's your name, son?
- Bruno Gaido, sir.

518
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:20.996
Aviation Machinist's Mate, Third Class.

519
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.417
Well, Bruno, you are now
an Aviation Machinist's Mate, First Class.

520
00:42:32.342 --> 00:42:35.093
Signal the fleet. Tell 'em it's time
to haul ass with Halsey.

521
00:42:35.178 --> 00:42:36.595
Yes, sir.

522
00:42:36.679 --> 00:42:38.930
You heard the man. Signal the fleet.

523
00:42:46.606 --> 00:42:49.608
[chattering, indistinct]

524
00:42:55.615 --> 00:42:59.034
Are you really sure you want your wife
flying wingman for you tonight?

525
00:43:00.119 --> 00:43:02.454
Yeah. Nobody told me
there'd be USO girls here tonight.

526
00:43:02.538 --> 00:43:04.206
- Hey.
- Hey.

527
00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:05.665
Hi.

528
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:07.250
I got us a table.

529
00:43:11.464 --> 00:43:14.466
- Wade, have you met Ann?
- Wade McClusky.

530
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:15.967
I fly with your husband.

531
00:43:18.179 --> 00:43:20.138
Hey, uh, you want a drink?

532
00:43:20.223 --> 00:43:22.140
I do, if you want me to dance.

533
00:43:24.936 --> 00:43:26.853
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

534
00:43:28.898 --> 00:43:30.649
How long have you been married?

535
00:43:30.733 --> 00:43:32.943
Long enough to know my husband's talents.

536
00:43:33.736 --> 00:43:35.904
Why isn't he commanding a squadron?

537
00:43:36.989 --> 00:43:38.907
Well, I don't make those decisions.

538
00:43:38.991 --> 00:43:40.969
- [Dick] Two mai tais, please.
- [bartender] Yes, sir.

539
00:43:40.993 --> 00:43:44.579
I understand before the war,
when it was about politics, but now?

540
00:43:45.248 --> 00:43:48.500
- I told you she was a firecracker.
- [McClusky chuckles]

541
00:43:48.584 --> 00:43:49.751
I have to say...

542
00:43:50.294 --> 00:43:54.631
I often wondered what kind of woman
would marry Dick Best, and, uh...

543
00:43:55.925 --> 00:43:57.676
well, you have not disappointed.

544
00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:02.180
Dick Best.

545
00:44:02.807 --> 00:44:04.724
- Hey, Layton.
- Hey.

546
00:44:04.809 --> 00:44:06.268
How was the Marshall Islands?

547
00:44:06.352 --> 00:44:08.019
Yeah, we got our feet wet.

548
00:44:10.189 --> 00:44:11.440
You keeping tabs on me?

549
00:44:11.524 --> 00:44:13.525
[sighs] I'm with Fleet Intelligence.

550
00:44:14.026 --> 00:44:15.193
Thank God.

551
00:44:15.278 --> 00:44:17.779
We're gonna need someone
as smart as you after Pearl.

552
00:44:18.906 --> 00:44:20.490
You gonna straighten those boys out?

553
00:44:20.575 --> 00:44:21.950
I'll do my best.

554
00:44:22.034 --> 00:44:23.702
[bartender] Your mai tai, sir.

555
00:44:23.786 --> 00:44:25.787
Well, I'm rooting for you.

556
00:44:26.664 --> 00:44:28.415
- Hey, say hi to the wife.
- You as well.

557
00:44:29.417 --> 00:44:30.959
[Ann] Just be straight with me.

558
00:44:31.043 --> 00:44:32.461
What am I missing?

559
00:44:34.338 --> 00:44:37.048
Every time we go up
in one of those planes...

560
00:44:38.092 --> 00:44:39.759
there's a chance we won't come back.

561
00:44:41.262 --> 00:44:44.764
Now, it's hard to follow a man
who doesn't know that.

562
00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.142
Or even worse...

563
00:44:47.768 --> 00:44:48.852
doesn't care.

564
00:44:54.025 --> 00:44:55.275
[Dick] Let's dance.

565
00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:56.443
Okay.

566
00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:57.694
Excuse me.

567
00:44:57.778 --> 00:45:00.197
[slow dance music playing]

568
00:45:04.577 --> 00:45:11.082
# All or nothing at all

569
00:45:13.294 --> 00:45:15.712
# Half a love

570
00:45:15.796 --> 00:45:20.967
# Never appealed to me

571
00:45:21.802 --> 00:45:24.721
# If your heart

572
00:45:24.805 --> 00:45:28.850
# Never could yield to me

573
00:45:29.977 --> 00:45:32.145
Then I'd rather

574
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:36.858
have nothing at all

575
00:45:36.943 --> 00:45:39.945
[insects buzzing]

576
00:45:56.128 --> 00:45:57.212
[whispers] Come to bed.

577
00:46:13.104 --> 00:46:14.437
[door opens]

578
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:19.109
[sighs]

579
00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.444
Welcome abÎ¿ard Enterprise.

580
00:46:22.154 --> 00:46:23.947
You're replacing good men.

581
00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:26.950
Much earlier than me
or the Navy wanted, but...

582
00:46:28.327 --> 00:46:30.787
Well, that's the hand we've been dealt.
[sighs]

583
00:46:30.871 --> 00:46:34.457
Now, you're going in the rotation,
and as XO, it's my job to make sure

584
00:46:34.542 --> 00:46:36.668
you're worth more than
a bucket of warm spit.

585
00:46:37.378 --> 00:46:38.837
The Japs are waiting for us,

586
00:46:38.921 --> 00:46:41.172
so we need pilots who can hold their own.

587
00:46:41.716 --> 00:46:42.882
[door opens]

588
00:46:42.967 --> 00:46:44.342
Hey.

589
00:46:44.427 --> 00:46:45.802
[sighs] You gotta see this.

590
00:46:51.684 --> 00:46:53.685
[thunder rumbling]

591
00:47:11.912 --> 00:47:15.165
What the hell are Army planes
doing on a carrier?

592
00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:18.543
[rumbling continues]

593
00:47:18.628 --> 00:47:20.420
[Halsey] Well, Mr. Browning,

594
00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:22.756
the commander of those bombers?

595
00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.008
Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle.

596
00:47:25.092 --> 00:47:27.218
Maybe the best pilot in the world.

597
00:47:27.303 --> 00:47:30.972
And he intends to launch
his planes off the Hornet,

598
00:47:31.057 --> 00:47:34.225
strike Tokyo, and then land in Free China.

599
00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:35.310
Captain?

600
00:47:39.857 --> 00:47:41.983
Enemy pickets 50 miles out.

601
00:47:42.068 --> 00:47:43.276
They're gonna blow our cover.

602
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:45.654
Every mile we get Doolittle
closer to Japan,

603
00:47:45.738 --> 00:47:48.490
is fuel he can use
to get the hell out of there.

604
00:47:48.574 --> 00:47:50.909
But I'm not gonna risk these carriers.

605
00:47:51.911 --> 00:47:53.495
What do we tell Doolittle?

606
00:47:53.579 --> 00:47:54.746
The truth.

607
00:47:57.958 --> 00:47:59.626
[rumbling continues]

608
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.341
We got the order to launch.

609
00:48:07.218 --> 00:48:08.468
How far out are we?

610
00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:11.304
Too far.

611
00:48:12.098 --> 00:48:14.599
We'll probably end up ditching
in the East China Sea.

612
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:18.186
But if we bomb Tokyo,

613
00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:21.189
we'll be the first enemy
in Japan's history

614
00:48:21.273 --> 00:48:23.441
to hit their home territory.

615
00:48:23.526 --> 00:48:25.652
If any of you want to bow out...

616
00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:27.946
now's your chance.

617
00:48:30.908 --> 00:48:32.909
We all wanna fly, sir.

618
00:48:35.204 --> 00:48:36.621
Man your planes.

619
00:48:36.706 --> 00:48:38.540
I'll see you all in China.

620
00:48:42.545 --> 00:48:45.505
They can't take off.
Certainly not with a load.

621
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:48.341
And they sure as hell can't land.

622
00:48:48.426 --> 00:48:50.385
Ten bucks says they don't
make it off the deck.

623
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:52.262
Yeah, I'll take that bet.

624
00:49:35.931 --> 00:49:38.391
[woman on radio]
Hello, everyone. This is Radio Tokyo,

625
00:49:38.476 --> 00:49:41.728
talking about the collapse
of American forces in the Philippines.

626
00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:44.564
- Our glorious Japanese forces...
- Evening, gents.

627
00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:46.691
[switching radio channel]

628
00:49:46.776 --> 00:49:49.194
[men shouting on radio, indistinct]

629
00:49:49.278 --> 00:49:50.820
[siren blaring on radio]

630
00:49:50.905 --> 00:49:52.363
What's going on, Captain?

631
00:49:52.448 --> 00:49:54.240
Those sound like air raid sirens to me.

632
00:49:56.702 --> 00:49:59.245
- [siren blaring, distant]
- [explosions]

633
00:50:01.624 --> 00:50:03.541
[chandelier clinking]

634
00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.631
[speaking Japanese]

635
00:50:23.062 --> 00:50:24.437
Bombs away, sir.

636
00:50:24.522 --> 00:50:25.855
Let's get out of here.

637
00:50:45.209 --> 00:50:46.292
[sighs]

638
00:50:51.048 --> 00:50:53.007
- What? No.
- Taking these hostage.

639
00:50:53.092 --> 00:50:54.634
Just half an hour.

640
00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:56.427
Does America winning the war

641
00:50:56.512 --> 00:50:59.013
really depend on Edwin Layton
working himself to death?

642
00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:02.392
Some of our boys bombed Tokyo today.

643
00:51:04.436 --> 00:51:06.604
They were supposed to land in Free China,

644
00:51:06.689 --> 00:51:10.108
but they're probably gonna run out of fuel
and have to ditch in the China Sea.

645
00:51:10.818 --> 00:51:15.071
If by some miracle they actually make it
into Japanese occupied territory,

646
00:51:15.155 --> 00:51:17.156
they'll be tortured and executed.

647
00:51:18.659 --> 00:51:19.951
What can you do?

648
00:51:20.578 --> 00:51:21.661
Most likely nothing.

649
00:51:23.038 --> 00:51:26.249
But we're not gonna lose any more men
because I didn't dig deep enough.

650
00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.215
I'll fix you a sandwich.

651
00:51:41.181 --> 00:51:42.765
[engine rumbling]

652
00:51:45.895 --> 00:51:48.855
I keep recalculating,
but with this steady tailwind...

653
00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.231
You think we're over land?

654
00:51:51.025 --> 00:51:52.275
Yeah. Maybe.

655
00:51:52.359 --> 00:51:53.693
[thunderclap]

656
00:51:55.321 --> 00:51:56.654
Only one way to find out.

657
00:52:01.368 --> 00:52:03.494
[thunderclaps]

658
00:52:03.579 --> 00:52:04.704
[metal clangs]

659
00:52:08.042 --> 00:52:09.542
Everyone, we gotta bail out.

660
00:52:15.716 --> 00:52:17.842
[wind gusts]

661
00:52:21.597 --> 00:52:24.432
I don't know if we're
over Chinese or Jap territory.

662
00:52:24.516 --> 00:52:25.725
So, watch yourselves.

663
00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:27.352
I'll see you all in Quzhou.

664
00:52:28.437 --> 00:52:30.355
[thunderclaps]

665
00:52:37.696 --> 00:52:38.863
You're next, Potter.

666
00:53:06.976 --> 00:53:08.643
[Yamaguchi speaking Japanese]

667
00:53:09.228 --> 00:53:10.895
[Yamamoto speaking Japanese]

668
00:53:51.186 --> 00:53:52.746
[Doolittle] You have a train station...

669
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.357
Smoke comes out the train. I'm a friend.

670
00:53:56.442 --> 00:53:58.234
American. I'm an ally.

671
00:53:58.694 --> 00:53:59.777
I need to get to Quzhou.

672
00:53:59.862 --> 00:54:01.446
- [soldier speaking Mandarin]
- Quzhou.

673
00:54:02.197 --> 00:54:03.573
- Hello.
- Hello.

674
00:54:04.491 --> 00:54:06.951
My name is Zhu Xuesan.

675
00:54:07.036 --> 00:54:08.161
Schoolteacher.

676
00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:10.246
You... you are American?

677
00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:12.331
American. I bombed Japan yesterday.

678
00:54:12.416 --> 00:54:14.500
Where... where's the plane?

679
00:54:14.585 --> 00:54:17.545
It crashed. I bailed out
and landed in the water last night.

680
00:54:17.629 --> 00:54:19.797
Where's, uh, para... parachute?

681
00:54:20.799 --> 00:54:21.966
I left it at the shore.

682
00:54:22.051 --> 00:54:24.802
Ask them. I knocked on their door
in the middle of the night.

683
00:54:25.888 --> 00:54:27.138
[speaking Mandarin]

684
00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:30.850
[talking, indistinct]

685
00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:33.227
[speaking Mandarin]

686
00:54:34.563 --> 00:54:36.272
He say you lie.

687
00:54:38.025 --> 00:54:40.443
- [speaks Mandarin]
- [Xuesan] He want your gun.

688
00:54:40.527 --> 00:54:41.861
[shouts in Mandarin]

689
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:46.824
I'm an American officer. I keep my gun.

690
00:54:46.909 --> 00:54:48.576
[shouting in Mandarin]

691
00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.203
[speaking Mandarin]

692
00:54:52.539 --> 00:54:55.500
[in English] You bomb Japan?

693
00:54:58.128 --> 00:54:59.128
I sure did.

694
00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:02.131
- Welcome. Welcome.
- Hi.

695
00:55:02.216 --> 00:55:03.382
I need to get to Quzhou.

696
00:55:03.467 --> 00:55:05.051
- To Quzhou.
- Quzhou.

697
00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:06.636
- Quzhou.
- Quzhou.

698
00:55:07.346 --> 00:55:08.429
[Doolittle] Yeah.

699
00:55:09.181 --> 00:55:12.767
[Nimitz] The Japanese are sending
their carriers into the Coral Sea.

700
00:55:13.352 --> 00:55:14.393
Yes, sir.

701
00:55:14.478 --> 00:55:16.979
They're trying to break our lifeline
with Australia.

702
00:55:21.527 --> 00:55:23.736
Send a secure message to Admiral Halsey.

703
00:55:23.821 --> 00:55:27.573
I want Enterprise to join Yorktown
and Lexington in the Coral Sea.

704
00:55:27.658 --> 00:55:29.909
- And tell Halsey time is a factor.
- Yes, sir.

705
00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:32.495
- There's something else.
- There always is.

706
00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.581
- I heard a theory.
- What kind of theory?

707
00:55:35.666 --> 00:55:38.126
According to one of my officers,
Coral Sea is just a warm-up.

708
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:41.337
He thinks that the Japanese are planning
something bigger. Much bigger.

709
00:55:41.421 --> 00:55:42.964
What makes him think that?

710
00:55:43.048 --> 00:55:45.716
Little bits and pieces
that we've intercepted.

711
00:55:45.801 --> 00:55:48.761
A message about a battleship
not being ready for an upcoming operation.

712
00:55:48.846 --> 00:55:50.972
Request for maps of the Aleutian Islands.

713
00:55:51.056 --> 00:55:52.181
What's the target?

714
00:55:52.266 --> 00:55:53.349
We don't know yet.

715
00:55:54.226 --> 00:55:55.601
Do you trust this officer?

716
00:55:56.645 --> 00:55:58.396
He's the most brilliant man I know.

717
00:55:58.939 --> 00:56:00.648
Well, have him figure it out.

718
00:56:04.736 --> 00:56:06.696
[Xuesan] Always no match.

719
00:56:16.832 --> 00:56:18.207
Keep it.

720
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:19.750
Thank you.

721
00:56:19.835 --> 00:56:22.003
[airplane engines whirring]

722
00:56:24.882 --> 00:56:26.591
[soldier speaking Mandarin]

723
00:56:36.268 --> 00:56:38.060
[men scream]

724
00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:42.231
[airplane engine rumbling]

725
00:56:49.281 --> 00:56:50.948
There are no installations here.

726
00:56:52.326 --> 00:56:53.326
What's their target?

727
00:56:53.994 --> 00:56:55.286
People are target.

728
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:57.246
[pants] People.

729
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.584
People.

730
00:57:01.668 --> 00:57:03.252
And we just made it worse.

731
00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:06.047
[women shouting in Mandarin]

732
00:57:10.302 --> 00:57:11.427
I have to go.

733
00:57:11.511 --> 00:57:13.179
My family.

734
00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:15.890
They... they take you Quzhou.

735
00:57:16.683 --> 00:57:18.100
Help find your men.

736
00:57:18.185 --> 00:57:19.894
Thank you.

737
00:57:19.978 --> 00:57:21.479
For everything.

738
00:57:39.957 --> 00:57:41.791
[Halsey] Twenty four hours too late.

739
00:57:42.501 --> 00:57:44.835
Damn it. Why couldn't we have been here?

740
00:57:45.837 --> 00:57:48.965
This leaves us and Hornet
as the only carriers in the Pacific.

741
00:57:55.722 --> 00:57:57.139
[officer] Attention on deck!

742
00:58:00.435 --> 00:58:03.646
I wanna talk to McClusky and Best.

743
00:58:08.235 --> 00:58:10.027
As you were.

744
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.991
[sighs] Oh, for Christ's sake.

745
00:58:16.368 --> 00:58:17.368
You okay, Admiral?

746
00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:19.912
I got this damn rash.

747
00:58:20.747 --> 00:58:23.541
Listen up. I'm done playing politics.

748
00:58:23.625 --> 00:58:28.129
The Navy... hell, the whole damn country
is counting on us.

749
00:58:28.213 --> 00:58:30.381
And I need my best men in the right spots.

750
00:58:30.465 --> 00:58:32.216
So, McClusky...

751
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:36.095
you are now in charge of the air group.

752
00:58:36.847 --> 00:58:39.807
I don't have a lick of confidence
in those damn torpedoes.

753
00:58:39.891 --> 00:58:41.642
So I want you in a dive bomber.

754
00:58:43.562 --> 00:58:46.564
And Best, I'm bumping you up from XO.

755
00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:50.860
You're the new skipper of Bombing Six.

756
00:58:52.904 --> 00:58:54.155
Good luck, boys.

757
00:58:57.284 --> 00:58:59.994
Well, I guess you're gonna
have to learn to fly an SBD.

758
00:59:00.996 --> 00:59:02.830
I've logged plenty of hours
in the Dauntless.

759
00:59:03.332 --> 00:59:05.291
Not diving at a live target.

760
00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:08.794
Can't be that hard. I mean, you do it.

761
00:59:13.759 --> 00:59:15.718
[man shouting in Japanese]

762
00:59:25.854 --> 00:59:27.313
[speaking Japanese]

763
01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.589
So, I just got off the phone
with Washington,

764
01:00:35.674 --> 01:00:39.718
and their intelligence guys think
you're wrong about this big operation.

765
01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:42.930
They think that the Japs are sending
their carriers back into the Coral Sea.

766
01:00:43.014 --> 01:00:45.683
Yeah. And they've ordered me
to keep Enterprise down there.

767
01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:46.892
That's a mistake.

768
01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:49.520
Washington is starting
from a faulty assumption

769
01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:51.355
and looking for evidence
to corroborate it.

770
01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:53.732
So, what's the Japs' real target?

771
01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:55.734
We believe it's Midway.

772
01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:58.070
They see our base there
as a step towards Hawaii

773
01:00:58.155 --> 01:00:59.989
and eventually the West Coast.

774
01:01:01.283 --> 01:01:03.200
- When?
- In a few weeks.

775
01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:08.831
I think it's time to pay a visit
to your friends in Station HYPO.

776
01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:10.541
Matt, bring the car around.

777
01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:13.502
[fence rattles]

778
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:24.138
I have to warn you, sir,
codebreakers are a rare breed.

779
01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:26.724
Rochefort's way of doing
things is especially...

780
01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:27.892
particular.

781
01:01:27.976 --> 01:01:31.520
I don't care if he consults coffee grounds
while doing the boogie-woogie,

782
01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:33.606
as long as the Intel is good.

783
01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:35.024
[officer] Attention on deck.

784
01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.568
Carry on, gentlemen.

785
01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:41.489
[Edwin] Where's Rochefort?

786
01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:45.075
If you'll follow me, sir.

787
01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.871
Didn't realize that the Navy
had so many trained codebreakers.

788
01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:50.122
We don't.

789
01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:52.750
Most of these men were
in the band on the California.

790
01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:55.836
But since we don't have
much use for bands these days,

791
01:01:55.921 --> 01:01:57.922
Rochefort thought
that their musical abilities

792
01:01:58.006 --> 01:02:00.633
might make them naturals
at breaking the rhythms of ciphers.

793
01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:06.013
[clears throat]

794
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.564
Sorry, Admiral, it, uh,

795
01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:17.775
gets cold down here in the dungeon.

796
01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:20.611
I'm told you're brilliant.

797
01:02:23.657 --> 01:02:27.326
Well, Lieutenant Commander Layton
has been known to exaggerate.

798
01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:29.078
I hope not.

799
01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:32.540
He told me he's absolutely certain
the Japs are gonna hit Midway,

800
01:02:32.624 --> 01:02:36.752
and I need to know
whether or not I can believe him.

801
01:02:36.836 --> 01:02:40.005
Well, if you don't believe him,
we'll all be speaking Japanese.

802
01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:42.925
Or, most likely, we'll be dead.

803
01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.931
Show me how this works.

804
01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:50.266
You mean, like a tour?

805
01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:51.976
Exactly.

806
01:02:52.477 --> 01:02:53.811
Like a tour.

807
01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:55.187
So this is where it starts.

808
01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:58.857
We intercept roughly 60%
of secure Japanese radio traffic,

809
01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:00.609
and we've cracked enough of their code

810
01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:03.404
to be able to break
about 40% of those messages.

811
01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:07.616
So we're able to read about a quarter
of their secure communications?

812
01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:09.910
Uh, no. Not exactly.

813
01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:11.745
Here's some of our, uh,

814
01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:13.289
cracked messages.

815
01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.293
[Nimitz] It's gibberish to me.

816
01:03:17.377 --> 01:03:19.753
Yes, but if you read enough of it...

817
01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:21.839
Rochefort has a gift
for assembling the fragments.

818
01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:23.966
He can recall a message
from two months ago,

819
01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.884
and plug it into today's intercept.

820
01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:29.263
Explain the disagreement with Washington.

821
01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:33.851
Well, we all have access
to the same raw information,

822
01:03:33.935 --> 01:03:37.187
but, uh, over here,
is where our paths diverge.

823
01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:40.899
- Translation and analysis.
- Now, Washington agrees with us...

824
01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:43.777
that Japs are gonna attack
a major target code-named AF.

825
01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:47.031
But Washington believes
that AF is located in the South Pacific,

826
01:03:47.115 --> 01:03:50.242
which is why they ordered you
to keep Enterprise down there.

827
01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:52.786
Do you have any direct proof
that they're wrong?

828
01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:54.246
Direct proof? No, but...

829
01:03:55.707 --> 01:03:56.915
[sighs] Sir.

830
01:03:58.293 --> 01:04:02.421
Imagine that you're throwing a wedding
and maybe I've never seen the invitation,

831
01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:05.633
but I hear from the caterers
that they have an event on a certain date.

832
01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:09.011
The flower guy is buying up
all the roses on the island.

833
01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:10.846
The best band is booked.

834
01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:13.557
That's what signal intelligence
can give you.

835
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:15.601
Clues.

836
01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.061
Not a definitive answer.

837
01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:20.105
Sir? After Pearl, you told me
to stick to my guns.

838
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.733
I swear to you, Joe's right about this.

839
01:04:24.653 --> 01:04:26.153
[sighs]

840
01:04:26.237 --> 01:04:28.656
I'm not generally predisposed

841
01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:31.367
to trust a bunch of tuba players

842
01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:34.953
led by a man wearing fuzzy slippers.

843
01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:36.705
But...

844
01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:39.166
I'll figure a way to get
the Enterprise back here.

845
01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:43.587
Meantime, you gentlemen
need to convince Washington...

846
01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:47.716
that the Japs' real target is Midway.

847
01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:49.176
How, sir?

848
01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:52.388
Washington doesn't exactly have
a habit of listening to us.

849
01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:55.557
Well, I'm sure you'll think of something.

850
01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.647
[knocks]

851
01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:04.983
[Halsey] Come in.

852
01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:10.864
An eyes-only message from Pearl.

853
01:05:17.956 --> 01:05:18.956
Nimitz.

854
01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:21.709
He wants us to be spotted.

855
01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:24.336
Because if the Japs see us,

856
01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:28.090
we can break our standing orders
with Washington and return to Pearl.

857
01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:31.093
[lighter clicks]

858
01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:33.804
We never received this message.

859
01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.351
[officer] Sir? The admiral needs you.

860
01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:44.565
[Nimitz] Okay.

861
01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:46.900
Yeah. Okay.

862
01:05:46.985 --> 01:05:48.444
Well, keep me informed.

863
01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:50.821
That was Washington.

864
01:05:50.905 --> 01:05:53.574
They've intercepted
several Japanese messages

865
01:05:53.658 --> 01:05:56.160
claiming that the target
of their upcoming attack

866
01:05:56.911 --> 01:05:58.370
is out of fresh water.

867
01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:00.622
Interesting, sir.

868
01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:03.584
I heard that Midway accidentally sent out

869
01:06:03.668 --> 01:06:06.837
an unencrypted transmission
that their water plant was broken.

870
01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:09.465
And is their water plant broken?

871
01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:12.009
Not that I know of, sir.

872
01:06:12.761 --> 01:06:14.845
But that proves Midway is AF.

873
01:06:18.433 --> 01:06:21.518
Okay. Tell your man Rochefort
that everyone now agrees

874
01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:24.104
on where his wedding is gonna be held.

875
01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:26.732
We just need to know
how many guests are coming

876
01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:29.568
and when they plan to arrive.

877
01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.047
[Ford laughs]

878
01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:51.924
Mack, I think we found the spot.

879
01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:54.885
Can't say, Mr. Ford, that I've ever helped
a big-time Hollywood director

880
01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:56.678
scout for a movie before.

881
01:06:56.763 --> 01:07:00.224
What kind of film you planning to make
in a godforsaken place like this?

882
01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:01.892
Friend of mine in the Navy

883
01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:05.187
said that I might be able
to find some real action here.

884
01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:06.688
I think I've been hoodwinked.

885
01:07:07.398 --> 01:07:10.169
I don't know, sir. From the way
we've been fortifying this little island,

886
01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:12.444
- I'd say your friend has some good Intel.
- [laughs]

887
01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:16.865
[Dickinson] Attention on deck!

888
01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:20.285
Very funny.

889
01:07:20.954 --> 01:07:22.496
- Sit the hell down.
- [laughs]

890
01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:27.459
I'm gonna keep this short.

891
01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:30.963
I know some of you thought I was
a pain in the ass as XO, but...

892
01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:33.006
that's about to get worse.

893
01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:35.217
We're headed back to Pearl to resupply,

894
01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:38.220
and it's probably because
something big is coming down the pipe.

895
01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:40.681
I'm therefore doubling
our scouting flights,

896
01:07:40.765 --> 01:07:44.184
and I expect you to practice diving runs
whenever you get a chance.

897
01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:46.436
Don't be the man who lets down
the squadron

898
01:07:46.521 --> 01:07:48.313
when we finally face the Japs.

899
01:07:50.191 --> 01:07:51.400
Dismissed.

900
01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:00.868
Can I talk to you, sir?

901
01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:06.790
I don't know if I can do this, sir.

902
01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:08.792
I thought I was a good pilot, but...

903
01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:11.420
I've lost my confidence.

904
01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:14.965
[sighs]

905
01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:16.842
Why did you become a pilot?

906
01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:20.554
Your dad wanted you to be an officer, huh?

907
01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:25.267
Actually, my dad didn't have
much respect for officers.

908
01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.542
Said that most of them didn't know
their ass from their elbow.

909
01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:32.649
You know,
my dad was a tough son of a bitch.

910
01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:35.027
You know how I got his respect?

911
01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.653
By always staying in the fight.

912
01:08:38.323 --> 01:08:40.991
I wish I had the luxury
of worrying about your confidence,

913
01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:44.745
but we're short on pilots,
so you gotta suck it up.

914
01:08:47.165 --> 01:08:48.248
Yes, sir.

915
01:08:49.208 --> 01:08:50.292
Wait.

916
01:08:54.589 --> 01:08:56.840
From now on, you're my wing man.

917
01:08:56.925 --> 01:08:58.926
I'll be lookin' out for you.

918
01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:01.261
Now, go suit up for a scouting flight.

919
01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:07.142
Tell me. What's your secret?

920
01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.061
My secret?

921
01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:11.355
He wants to know why nothing bothers you.

922
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.901
My uncle was a welder
on the Empire State Building.

923
01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:19.905
He'd walk on a beam 1,000 feet
up in the sky, no ropes, nothing.

924
01:09:19.989 --> 01:09:23.450
And everyone thought he was crazy,
but to him, he was just doing a job.

925
01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.120
And one Sunday, he's walking home
from church, a block away from his house,

926
01:09:27.205 --> 01:09:31.333
when a cab jumps over the curb,
splatters him like a bug.

927
01:09:32.126 --> 01:09:33.627
You never know what's gonna get you.

928
01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:36.088
So why worry about it?

929
01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:40.217
Hey! Let's go.

930
01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:43.595
Simple scouting mission.

931
01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.223
On the way home,
we practice the dive, you got it?

932
01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:48.517
- Yes, sir.
- We'll be going deeper this time,

933
01:09:48.601 --> 01:09:51.478
so don't pull up too fast on the bottom
or you'll black out.

934
01:10:11.666 --> 01:10:12.666
Oh, shit.

935
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:14.876
The ship's moving too slow.

936
01:10:41.863 --> 01:10:44.281
Abort! Abort takeoff!

937
01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.076
The ship's too slow!

938
01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:51.413
We're not generating
enough wind for launch.

939
01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:53.790
[screaming] No, stop! Stop!

940
01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:10.557
Plane in water.

941
01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:12.184
Turn starboard, goddamn it!

942
01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.560
Turn starboard.

943
01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:54.184
Guess you don't like the chokers either.

944
01:11:54.268 --> 01:11:58.021
I'd get grease on that thing
just trying to button it up.

945
01:11:58.106 --> 01:12:00.273
Makes me look like a damn waiter.

946
01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:03.485
[chuckles] Nobody would ever confuse you
for a waiter.

947
01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:04.945
[chuckles]

948
01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:08.490
You look like hell, Bill.

949
01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:09.616
I'm fine.

950
01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:12.744
Tired.

951
01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:14.371
Every man on the ship's tired.

952
01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:16.373
We've been out six months without a break.

953
01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:18.125
There's a big difference between tired

954
01:12:18.209 --> 01:12:19.835
and whatever the hell you are.

955
01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:22.796
You're going ashore to the hospital.

956
01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:25.757
Does this look like a battle wound to you?

957
01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:27.467
It's a damn rash.

958
01:12:27.552 --> 01:12:29.386
Now, what are my men gonna think

959
01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:32.347
when their admiral up and decides
he needs a vacation?

960
01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:34.182
It's a direct order, Bill.

961
01:12:43.651 --> 01:12:45.235
And we keep losing men.

962
01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:47.195
It's not even the Japs.

963
01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:51.616
Herman crashed on takeoff.
Tom Durkin disappeared on patrol.

964
01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.702
And there's this other kid...

965
01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.413
Willie West.

966
01:12:57.582 --> 01:13:01.293
He didn't think he could cut it.
I figured it was just the usual jitters.

967
01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:03.753
I take him under my wing.

968
01:13:06.424 --> 01:13:08.592
I wrote a letter to his mother yesterday,

969
01:13:08.676 --> 01:13:10.427
telling her I failed him.

970
01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:21.188
It's not your fault.

971
01:13:22.356 --> 01:13:23.857
He was right to be scared.

972
01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:27.777
Everybody knows something big is coming.

973
01:13:27.862 --> 01:13:31.239
We're talking about a couple dozen planes
against the whole Japanese fleet.

974
01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:34.367
And if we lose, they own the Pacific,

975
01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:36.453
and they raid the West Coast.

976
01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:40.040
Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles...

977
01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:42.626
will burn.

978
01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:45.462
And this damn war will last a decade.

979
01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.966
I've never seen you this worried before.

980
01:13:51.219 --> 01:13:54.221
I never had to worry
when it was just me and my plane, but...

981
01:13:56.307 --> 01:13:58.725
Ann, it's different now.
I have to lead these men.

982
01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:02.312
What do I say to them?

983
01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:03.521
Just...

984
01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.732
be honest.

985
01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:09.444
And let them see what I can see.

986
01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:14.074
They'll follow you anywhere, Dick Best.

987
01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:26.503
[Dick sighs]

988
01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:37.055
[officer] Sir, the Yorktown
was hit by a 500-pound bomb.

989
01:14:37.765 --> 01:14:39.641
We need at least two weeks for repairs.

990
01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:40.725
[Nimitz] Not acceptable.

991
01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:44.271
Our initial estimate was three
months in dry dock in Seattle.

992
01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:48.149
- [metal clanging]
- [tools whirring]

993
01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:51.111
[Nimitz] I need this ship.

994
01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:55.407
I don't care if you need to
patch the deck with plywood...

995
01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:58.910
Yorktown sails in 72 hours.

996
01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:02.914
Halsey is out.

997
01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:04.708
He's in the hospital with shingles.

998
01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:08.503
So I've given command of Task Force 16
to Admiral Spruance.

999
01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:10.171
We're setting a trap.

1000
01:15:10.256 --> 01:15:13.258
Our carriers will lie in wait
northeast of Midway.

1001
01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:16.720
Now, we have set up a picket line
of submarines here.

1002
01:15:17.388 --> 01:15:18.722
As for Midway itself,

1003
01:15:18.806 --> 01:15:21.975
we have crammed every plane
we can spare onto that runway.

1004
01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:23.727
But this time, if we're lucky...

1005
01:15:24.312 --> 01:15:26.271
surprise will be on our side.

1006
01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:32.402
Layton, how reliable are these estimates
of the Japanese positions?

1007
01:15:32.486 --> 01:15:35.989
They represent our best guess,
based on the intelligence that we have.

1008
01:15:36.073 --> 01:15:38.783
I can't plan around your guess.

1009
01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:42.370
I understand that we're asking
the impossible,

1010
01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:44.664
but we need you to be specific.

1011
01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:46.249
[sighs]

1012
01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:49.836
The Japanese will attack
on the morning of June 4

1013
01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:53.173
from the Northwest,
at a bearing of 325 degrees.

1014
01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:58.553
They will be sighted 175 miles from Midway
at 0700 local time.

1015
01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.683
I trust Layton and his team.

1016
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:06.061
Make your plans accordingly.

1017
01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:07.979
Dismissed.

1018
01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:11.395
- [alarm blaring]
- [man on speakers] Clear the deck.

1019
01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:15.153
Torpedo Squadron Six coming in from Pearl.

1020
01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:19.074
Clear the deck. Torpedo Squadron Six
coming in from Pearl.

1021
01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:24.287
[metal rattles]

1022
01:16:25.706 --> 01:16:27.082
[Browning] He's in trouble.

1023
01:16:30.044 --> 01:16:31.378
Shit!

1024
01:16:34.632 --> 01:16:36.800
[man on speakers] We need a rescue team!

1025
01:16:36.884 --> 01:16:38.885
- Easy. Easy. Easy.
- Easy, boys. Easy.

1026
01:16:38.969 --> 01:16:40.553
[Lindsey groaning]

1027
01:16:40.638 --> 01:16:43.098
Get him over.
Hand him off. One, two, three.

1028
01:16:43.182 --> 01:16:45.266
- [Lindsey screams]
- Easy, Lieutenant.

1029
01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:47.519
- How's your back doing, Lieutenant?
- [groans]

1030
01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:49.938
It feels like someone dropped
a tractor on it.

1031
01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:55.235
[McClusky] So that's what
your squadrons are up against?

1032
01:16:55.319 --> 01:16:56.903
Four carriers,

1033
01:16:56.987 --> 01:16:59.072
approximately 250 aircraft,

1034
01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:00.865
plus the biggest battleship in the world.

1035
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.201
Yeah, not to mention
the Japs are unbeatable.

1036
01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:05.620
We've got the drop on the bastards.

1037
01:17:06.497 --> 01:17:07.539
Make it count.

1038
01:17:10.543 --> 01:17:11.918
How's Lindsey?

1039
01:17:12.002 --> 01:17:13.128
Not good, sir.

1040
01:17:14.422 --> 01:17:15.422
[door opens]

1041
01:17:16.257 --> 01:17:17.882
[door closes]

1042
01:17:20.594 --> 01:17:21.636
[Dick sighs]

1043
01:17:22.263 --> 01:17:24.931
- Do you trust the intelligence?
- I'm trying.

1044
01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:27.517
Because we're betting
a hell of a lot on this hand.

1045
01:17:27.601 --> 01:17:28.935
Yeah.

1046
01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:31.312
I can't believe
I'm saying this, but, uh...

1047
01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:34.524
I liked you better when you were cocky.

1048
01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:37.068
- Hey, you don't have to worry about me.
- Oh, really?

1049
01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:40.655
You've been blaming yourself
for that kid who went down.

1050
01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:43.283
How do I make it right?

1051
01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:46.870
Make sure your men are ready for tomorrow.

1052
01:17:46.954 --> 01:17:49.456
And you bring back
as many of 'em as you can.

1053
01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:50.999
[door opens]

1054
01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:52.667
Ship sighted.

1055
01:17:55.963 --> 01:17:57.714
[chattering, indistinct]

1056
01:17:57.798 --> 01:17:59.924
[ship horn blowing]

1057
01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:03.678
- [deck officer] It's the Yorktown!
- [cheers, applause]

1058
01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:07.432
[Dickinson] How the hell
did she get out of dry dock in time?

1059
01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:09.893
I don't know.

1060
01:18:09.977 --> 01:18:13.229
- I guess every battle needs a miracle.
- Whoo!

1061
01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:18.401
You've memorized every position
on that board, Layton.

1062
01:18:18.486 --> 01:18:19.486
Go home.

1063
01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:22.030
I think I'm going
to spend the night here, sir,

1064
01:18:22.114 --> 01:18:23.698
just in case anything comes up.

1065
01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:27.368
- Your wife doesn't mind?
- Well, she knows the drill.

1066
01:18:28.162 --> 01:18:31.247
My wife knows the drill too,
but she still minds.

1067
01:18:32.833 --> 01:18:36.336
When the war's over, I plan on spending
the rest of my life making it up to her.

1068
01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:40.256
Get some rest. Good night.

1069
01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:51.226
[bugle playing]

1070
01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:07.033
[marine captain]
They've scrambled all the squadrons.

1071
01:19:07.117 --> 01:19:09.452
Radar must've picked up something.

1072
01:19:09.537 --> 01:19:12.247
That's great, Mikey, that's great.

1073
01:19:12.331 --> 01:19:14.457
Next time, get the horn up
a little higher, all right?

1074
01:19:14.542 --> 01:19:16.061
- [Mikey] All right, sir.
- A little higher. Good.

1075
01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:18.169
All right. Lower the flag,
we're going again.

1076
01:19:21.507 --> 01:19:23.174
Get something in your stomachs.

1077
01:19:24.468 --> 01:19:26.094
It's gonna be a long day.

1078
01:19:33.727 --> 01:19:35.645
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, boys.

1079
01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:38.606
Nobody thinks we can go
toe-to-toe with the Japanese.

1080
01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:40.858
Not in a fair fight.

1081
01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:44.362
Today, we're gonna be big underdogs.

1082
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:46.030
Me?

1083
01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:48.575
I think the men in this room
can fly with anyone.

1084
01:19:48.659 --> 01:19:51.077
Maybe that's 'cause
I'm a cocky son of a bitch.

1085
01:19:53.372 --> 01:19:55.748
But it's also because
I've seen what you can do.

1086
01:19:59.086 --> 01:20:00.795
You're ready for this.

1087
01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:10.847
We're gonna give 'em a shellackin'.

1088
01:20:10.931 --> 01:20:13.182
[all chuckle]

1089
01:20:20.357 --> 01:20:23.192
[airplane engines roaring]

1090
01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.096
They're coming! The Japs are coming!

1091
01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:55.683
Mr. Ford! We have incoming aircraft.
We need to get you to a bunker.

1092
01:20:57.227 --> 01:20:58.853
- Incoming aircraft?
- [siren wailing]

1093
01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.230
Sir, you have to take cover, sir.

1094
01:21:03.233 --> 01:21:05.068
Holy shit! To the roof!

1095
01:21:05.152 --> 01:21:06.903
[marine captain] Mr. Ford, wait!

1096
01:21:06.987 --> 01:21:08.321
With all due respect, sir,

1097
01:21:08.405 --> 01:21:10.675
there isn't going to be a movie, sir,
if we don't get you to cover.

1098
01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:13.117
[Ford] I'm gonna shoot the damn picture.

1099
01:21:13.202 --> 01:21:14.702
Got it, Jackie?

1100
01:21:14.787 --> 01:21:16.120
Beautiful!

1101
01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:36.015
Are you okay?

1102
01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.101
Keep shooting. Keep shooting!

1103
01:21:43.107 --> 01:21:44.982
Japanese air attack reported on Midway.

1104
01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:47.694
And one of our scout planes
just sighted the enemy fleet.

1105
01:21:47.778 --> 01:21:48.820
Spotted where?

1106
01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:50.988
He reports carriers bearing 320 degrees,

1107
01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:53.950
180 miles Northwest of Midway.

1108
01:21:54.034 --> 01:21:56.577
Well, Layton,
you and Rochefort were only off

1109
01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:58.996
five minutes, five miles and five degrees.

1110
01:21:59.081 --> 01:22:01.040
Well, we'll endeavor
to do better next time, sir.

1111
01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:05.461
Give our pilots the enemy position.
Tell them to attack.

1112
01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:06.671
Yes, sir.

1113
01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:25.898

1116
01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:19.011
[Dick] Hey, Lindsey!

1117
01:24:19.847 --> 01:24:21.556
You still owe me 10 bucks.

1118
01:24:22.182 --> 01:24:25.226
You trying to collect
before I get myself shot down?

1119
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:28.604
Nah, I know you're good for it, Lindsey.
You don't have to fly today.

1120
01:24:28.689 --> 01:24:30.857
Nobody would doubt your courage.

1121
01:24:31.567 --> 01:24:33.484
I will lead my squadron in.

1122
01:24:39.032 --> 01:24:40.116
Good luck, sir.

1123
01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.701
I'll be right behind you.

1124
01:24:41.785 --> 01:24:44.203
I'll meet you at the Japanese fleet.

1125
01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:07.511
[speaking Japanese]

1126
01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:14.794
They got a Jintsu type cruiser.
Range 2,500 yards.

1127
01:26:14.878 --> 01:26:16.837
I'm not wasting a torpedo on a cruiser.

1128
01:26:16.922 --> 01:26:18.047
Where are the carriers?

1129
01:26:22.386 --> 01:26:24.387
[metal creaking]

1130
01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:29.934
- Sir, we need to go deep.
- Man battle stations.

1131
01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:33.854
Battle stations. Everybody, in your bunks.

[alarm blaring]

1133
01:26:40.696 --> 01:26:42.071
Well, Murray...

1134
01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:43.948
this is it.

1135
01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:26.073
The Enterprise has launched its SBDs
and their squadrons of marine dive bombers

1136
01:27:26.158 --> 01:27:28.409
following the new
sighting report out of Midway.

1137
01:27:32.664 --> 01:27:34.957
[McClusky on radio]
We gotta climb higher, boys.

1138
01:27:35.042 --> 01:27:36.751
We need to conserve fuel.

1139
01:27:38.837 --> 01:27:41.547
[Murray]
Approaching altitude of 14,000 feet.

1140
01:27:41.631 --> 01:27:43.632
Release your oxygen, sir.

1141
01:27:48.305 --> 01:27:49.388
[coughs]

1142
01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:54.101
Are you okay, sir?

1143
01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:56.604
[gasps] It's my oxygen.

1144
01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:58.397
Must've gotten a bad mix.

1145
01:27:58.482 --> 01:28:01.233
We have to go back.
It'll tear up your lungs.

1146
01:28:01.318 --> 01:28:05.029
I'm not sending the squadron out there
without their commander. [coughs]

1147
01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:08.157
[Brockman] There she is.

1148
01:28:08.241 --> 01:28:10.451
We got a carrier, maybe 4,000 yards.

1149
01:28:10.535 --> 01:28:12.244
Sir, the Japs are right on us.

1150
01:28:12.329 --> 01:28:13.704
Make tubes one and two ready.

1151
01:28:13.789 --> 01:28:17.833
Make tubes one and two
ready in all respects.

1152
01:28:17.918 --> 01:28:19.251
Tubes one and two ready, aye.

1153
01:28:24.174 --> 01:28:26.759

do you have visual?

[coughs]

1166
01:29:39.249 --> 01:29:40.249
Nothin'.

1167
01:29:40.333 --> 01:29:42.751
Must've gotten a bum sighting report.

1168
01:29:43.378 --> 01:29:45.754
Or maybe they've changed course.

1169
01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:48.841
Let's do a back search.

1170
01:29:50.927 --> 01:29:52.094
Here they come again.

1171
01:30:17.037 --> 01:30:18.579

to catch up with the carriers?

1180
01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:09.458
[McClusky's radio man] Sir, we've been
up here for almost two hours.

1181
01:32:09.482 --> 01:32:12.651
What if we run out of fuel,
and the whole squadron has to ditch?

1182
01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:16.447
Then I'll probably end up
scrubbing potatoes at Leavenworth.

1183
01:32:17.824 --> 01:32:20.075
To hell with it. Follow me, boys.

1184

Eighteen hundred!

1229
01:39:38.723 --> 01:39:39.848
Sixteen hundred!

1230
01:39:44.854 --> 01:39:46.688
Fifteen hundred!

1231
01:40:11.964 --> 01:40:13.673
That was a beauty, sir!

1232
01:40:13.758 --> 01:40:15.509
Right on her deck!

1233
01:40:33.069 --> 01:40:34.778
Any fighters on our tail?

1234
01:40:36.489 --> 01:40:38.907
No, sir.
They must be chasing someone else.

1235
01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:27.455
[grunts]

1236
01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:28.660
[O'Flaherty] We're going in!

1237
01:41:37.216 --> 01:41:39.759
O'Flaherty and Gaido are down, sir.

1238
01:41:39.844 --> 01:41:42.721
If you don't hit them damn Zeros,
we're gonna be joining 'em.

1239
01:41:52.398 --> 01:41:53.732
[grunts]

1240
01:41:58.654 --> 01:41:59.821
Are you okay, sir?

1241
01:42:01.616 --> 01:42:03.199
Radio our position.

1242
01:42:03.284 --> 01:42:06.536
We gotta get a ship out here
to pick up Gaido and O'Flaherty.

1243
01:42:26.807 --> 01:42:28.725
[alarm blaring]

1244
01:42:32.146 --> 01:42:33.563
[speaking Japanese]

1245
01:43:25.825 --> 01:43:27.826
Do you want us
to contact Admiral Spruance?

1246
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:30.161
No, he can't break radio silence.

1247
01:43:32.665 --> 01:43:33.790
For me?

1248
01:43:38.421 --> 01:43:40.672
Rochefort intercepted a Japanese signal.

1249
01:43:41.799 --> 01:43:44.634
He can't translate the body,
but look at the call sign.

1250
01:43:44.719 --> 01:43:46.052
That's from Admiral Nagumo.

1251
01:43:46.137 --> 01:43:49.074
But he's not transmitting from the Akagi.
He's transmitting from a cruiser.

1252
01:43:49.098 --> 01:43:51.683
Now, why the hell would Nagumo
leave his flagship?

1253
01:44:03.529 --> 01:44:05.488
[speaking Japanese]

1254
01:44:51.994 --> 01:44:54.746
[O'Flaherty] They taught us
about dehydration in flight school.

1255
01:44:55.456 --> 01:44:56.915
Your skin starts to crack.

1256
01:44:57.708 --> 01:44:59.375
- Liver fails.
- Knock it off.

1257
01:45:00.878 --> 01:45:04.089
- What if nobody finds us?
- We swim back to Pearl.

1258
01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:07.008
Good luck with sharks.

1259
01:45:07.968 --> 01:45:09.719
We'll need something to eat.

1260
01:45:13.182 --> 01:45:14.724
Wait. Wait. I see something.

1261
01:45:16.685 --> 01:45:18.436
Looks like a destroyer.

1262
01:45:18.521 --> 01:45:20.188
American or Jap?

1263
01:45:34.245 --> 01:45:36.204
[speaking Japanese]

1264
01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:40.250
[in English] You, tell us your ship,

1265
01:45:40.334 --> 01:45:42.585
or we throw you overboard.

1266
01:45:43.712 --> 01:45:44.754
Cigarette?

1267
01:45:47.341 --> 01:45:49.050
[speaking Japanese]

1268
01:46:00.271 --> 01:46:03.022
You know, I had a lot of friends
at Pearl Harbor.

1269
01:46:05.484 --> 01:46:07.652
So how about you go fuck yourself?

1270
01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:10.780
[snaps fingers]

1271
01:46:26.088 --> 01:46:27.172
[gasps]

1272
01:46:46.525 --> 01:46:48.443
[breathing heavily]

1273
01:46:56.035 --> 01:46:57.577
[speaking Japanese]

1274
01:47:18.891 --> 01:47:21.392
- [alarm blaring]
- [man on speakers, indistinct]

1275
01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:25.688
Murray, get something to eat.

1276
01:47:25.773 --> 01:47:27.815
I bet we're going back out there.

1277
01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:29.943
We have to go upstairs to report.

1278
01:47:30.694 --> 01:47:33.363
- Hey, what happened?
- I got strafed by a Zero.

1279
01:47:33.447 --> 01:47:36.658
[Dick] Hey, how'd you know
to follow that Jap destroyer?

1280
01:47:36.742 --> 01:47:38.326
I played a hunch.

1281
01:47:38.410 --> 01:47:41.037
Well, your hunch might have
won us this battle.

1282
01:47:41.121 --> 01:47:42.622
But I gotta tell ya...

1283
01:47:43.332 --> 01:47:45.875
that looked like some
cowboy bullshit to me.

1284
01:47:46.961 --> 01:47:48.920
Well, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

1285
01:47:49.004 --> 01:47:50.213
[gunfire]

1286
01:47:50.297 --> 01:47:51.673
[Spruance] Yorktown's hit.

1287
01:47:53.050 --> 01:47:54.259
What have we got left?

1288
01:47:54.343 --> 01:47:56.219
Couple of SBDs just returned.

1289
01:47:56.303 --> 01:47:58.721
- The pilots are coming up to report.
- [door opens]

1290
01:47:59.473 --> 01:48:01.933
[Spruance] What's the news
from the enemy fleet?

1291
01:48:02.017 --> 01:48:03.601
Three carriers down. One to go.

1292
01:48:03.686 --> 01:48:05.144
And our air group?

1293
01:48:05.229 --> 01:48:08.189
Only three torpedo bombers came back,
and they're all shot up.

1294
01:48:08.274 --> 01:48:09.607
What about the dive bombers?

1295
01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:12.151
We can probably scrounge up a dozen.

1296
01:48:12.236 --> 01:48:14.821
McClusky, you've been shot.

1297
01:48:14.905 --> 01:48:16.698
- I can fly, sir.
- The hell you can.

1298
01:48:16.782 --> 01:48:18.491
Get your ass down to sick bay.

1299
01:48:21.662 --> 01:48:24.831
Put the pilots you trust
in any plane that can fly.

1300
01:48:25.541 --> 01:48:26.666
Yes, sir.

1301
01:48:29.211 --> 01:48:30.461
[coughs]

1302
01:48:30.546 --> 01:48:32.255
- [retching]
- You okay, sir?

1303
01:48:32.339 --> 01:48:34.590
I'm fine. [coughs]

1304
01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:39.470
[pants]

1305
01:48:49.523 --> 01:48:51.774
Has anybody heard from Dickinson?

1306
01:48:52.318 --> 01:48:55.111
No. Not yet.

1307
01:48:55.195 --> 01:48:57.655
Look, I know you boys
have just been through hell.

1308
01:48:58.365 --> 01:49:00.825
But we gotta go back
and hit the last carrier.

1309
01:49:13.464 --> 01:49:15.131
I'll see if I can find more men.

1310
01:49:25.142 --> 01:49:26.809
[coughs]

1311
01:49:33.067 --> 01:49:34.108
Hey.

1312
01:49:35.611 --> 01:49:36.694
Strap up.

1313
01:49:37.738 --> 01:49:39.489
We're going back out.

1314
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:42.367
I'm sorry, sir, but I think
you need to find somebody else.

1315
01:49:43.619 --> 01:49:46.204
You don't know what it's like
to be in the back seat, sir.

1316
01:49:46.288 --> 01:49:48.664
You fly like you don't care
if we come home.

1317
01:49:54.213 --> 01:49:55.713
[coughs]

1318
01:49:57.049 --> 01:49:58.341
[sighs]

1319
01:50:00.344 --> 01:50:01.969
I wanna go home too.

1320
01:50:02.554 --> 01:50:05.556
I wanna spend more than
a few days at a time with my wife.

1321
01:50:06.308 --> 01:50:08.184
See my little girl grow up.

1322
01:50:09.019 --> 01:50:10.269
And you're right.

1323
01:50:11.939 --> 01:50:13.773
If we go out there,

1324
01:50:13.857 --> 01:50:15.942
we probably aren't coming back.

1325
01:50:16.693 --> 01:50:18.528
But this is our job,

1326
01:50:18.612 --> 01:50:21.739
and we're the guys who have to hold
the fort till the cavalry arrives.

1327
01:50:25.911 --> 01:50:28.037
Look, if you really can't fly,

1328
01:50:28.831 --> 01:50:30.289
I'll find someone else.

1329
01:50:30.374 --> 01:50:32.583
But you should get back in that plane.

1330
01:50:33.585 --> 01:50:36.671
You'll remember this moment
for the rest of your life.

1331
01:50:36.755 --> 01:50:40.633
And if you know that you came through
when people were counting on you,

1332
01:50:40.717 --> 01:50:42.552
you'll be able to face anything.

1333
01:50:54.857 --> 01:50:56.732
We've come this far, Murray.

1334
01:50:57.860 --> 01:50:59.986
Don't make me go back
out there without you.

1335
01:51:13.375 --> 01:51:14.834
I'll warm her up, sir.

1336
01:51:19.548 --> 01:51:27.548
[speaking Japanese]

1337
01:52:12.893 --> 01:52:13.935
Get ready, Murray.

1338
01:52:14.019 --> 01:52:16.437
We're not sneaking up on them this time.

1339
01:52:18.815 --> 01:52:20.399
Here they come!

1340
01:52:56.645 --> 01:52:57.937
[shouting in Japanese]

1341
01:53:16.164 --> 01:53:17.957
- [grunts]
- [screams]

1342
01:53:24.464 --> 01:53:26.591
[screams]

1343

Altitude.

1344
01:53:30.387 --> 01:53:32.138
We've got Zeroes on our tail.

1345
01:53:42.357 --> 01:53:44.525
[shouting, indistinct]

1346
01:54:12.095 --> 01:54:13.512
[grunts]

1347
01:54:25.150 --> 01:54:26.942
This is for Pearl.

1348
01:54:36.203 --> 01:54:38.162
[screams]

1349
01:55:01.561 --> 01:55:04.438
[chattering, indistinct]

1350
01:55:09.528 --> 01:55:10.611
Yeah. You're gonna be okay.

1351
01:55:13.115 --> 01:55:14.281
Thanks, boys.

1352
01:55:16.576 --> 01:55:17.743
What happened to you?

1353
01:55:17.828 --> 01:55:20.204
I ran out of fuel about 20 miles out.

1354
01:55:21.206 --> 01:55:22.623
Ditched next to the Phelps.

1355
01:55:24.835 --> 01:55:25.960
Where's Best?

1356
01:55:26.837 --> 01:55:28.212
That's one of his wing men.

1357
01:55:29.214 --> 01:55:30.923
He hasn't come back yet.

1358
01:55:32.259 --> 01:55:35.094
He's probably just taking a victory lap.

1359
01:55:40.058 --> 01:55:41.100
Yeah.

1360
01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:45.771
Hey.

1361
01:55:48.024 --> 01:55:50.651
Men like Dick Best are the reason
we're gonna win this war.

1362
01:55:55.407 --> 01:55:58.451
[man on speakers, indistinct]

1363
01:56:06.543 --> 01:56:08.169
Come on, Best.

1364
01:56:09.796 --> 01:56:10.796
Let's go.

1365
01:56:19.598 --> 01:56:20.598
Any news?

1366
01:56:21.141 --> 01:56:23.476
The kids are out back. Go, go.

1367
01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:25.895
Hi.

1368
01:56:27.606 --> 01:56:29.732
Cindy heard a rumor from the base.

1369
01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:31.734
There's a big battle,

1370
01:56:31.818 --> 01:56:34.069
and one of our carriers is sinking.

1371
01:56:34.154 --> 01:56:35.863
And the pilots?

1372
01:56:35.947 --> 01:56:37.615
It sounds like we lost a lot of them.

1373
01:56:38.492 --> 01:56:41.368
I'm gonna go powder my nose quickly.

1374
01:56:48.585 --> 01:56:50.544
[breathing heavily]

1375
01:57:00.555 --> 01:57:02.306
[breathes deeply]

1376
01:57:03.558 --> 01:57:06.352
The Japanese might charge
with their battleships.

1377
01:57:06.436 --> 01:57:08.646
So we will withdraw for the night.

1378
01:57:09.356 --> 01:57:11.649
But their fleet might be
out of range in the morning.

1379
01:57:11.733 --> 01:57:14.026
Nimitz ordered us to be judicious.

1380
01:57:14.110 --> 01:57:16.153
We won a great victory today.

1381
01:57:17.489 --> 01:57:18.823
Let's not blow it.

1382
01:57:31.127 --> 01:57:32.711
[chattering, indistinct]

1383
01:57:40.095 --> 01:57:42.471

[engine sputtering]

1385
01:57:53.942 --> 01:57:55.568
[engine stops]

1386
01:57:58.989 --> 01:58:00.990
[Dickinson] Goddamn it! Dick Best!

1387
01:58:05.287 --> 01:58:06.579
Hang in there, kid.

1388
01:58:06.663 --> 01:58:08.122
We're almost home.

1389
01:58:25.974 --> 01:58:27.016
I thought you were dead.

1390
01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:29.518
Yeah. They said the same thing about you.

1391
01:58:31.104 --> 01:58:32.646
I'm glad they were wrong.

1392
01:58:34.733 --> 01:58:36.108
Admiral's orders.

1393
01:58:36.818 --> 01:58:39.028
Give it to Murray. He earned it.

1394
01:58:41.823 --> 01:58:43.574
Give me your hand.

1395
01:58:45.410 --> 01:58:46.577
[coughs]

1396
01:58:46.661 --> 01:58:47.953
You okay?

1397
01:58:48.455 --> 01:58:49.914
[coughs]

1398
01:58:51.374 --> 01:58:52.416
Yeah.

1399
01:58:53.293 --> 01:58:54.335
Corpsman!

1400
01:58:54.419 --> 01:58:56.128
I need a corpsman!

1401
01:58:59.966 --> 01:59:00.966
I got you.

1402
01:59:02.302 --> 01:59:03.427
Here we go.

1403
01:59:12.479 --> 01:59:14.021
[Yamaguchi speaking Japanese]

1404
02:00:44.154 --> 02:00:45.612
What happened to Bruno?

1405
02:00:46.531 --> 02:00:49.408
PBY flew over his last known position.

1406
02:00:49.492 --> 02:00:51.744
They spotted an empty life raft.

1407
02:01:09.012 --> 02:01:11.055
[speaking Japanese]

1408
02:01:42.087 --> 02:01:43.587
[knocks]

1409
02:01:45.090 --> 02:01:46.298
[Yamamoto speaking Japanese]

1410
02:03:21.186 --> 02:03:22.644
The Japanese are retreating.

1411
02:03:33.865 --> 02:03:35.616
- We won.
- [sighs]

1412
02:04:08.608 --> 02:04:10.192
[phone rings]

1413
02:04:12.737 --> 02:04:14.071
[sighs]

1414
02:04:15.281 --> 02:04:16.782
God bless those boys.

1415
02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:19.952
Turns out all they needed
was a fair fight.

1416
02:05:03.705 --> 02:05:05.872
[speaking Japanese]

1417
02:05:45.496 --> 02:05:46.830
[Dick] Half our men...

1418
02:05:47.957 --> 02:05:49.833
dead or missing.

1419
02:05:50.835 --> 02:05:52.085
Yeah.

1420
02:05:52.170 --> 02:05:54.087
Hey, whatever happened to that whiskey?

1421
02:05:55.214 --> 02:05:57.632
I was waiting for you
to sneak out of sick bay.

1422
02:05:57.717 --> 02:05:58.884
[Dick sighs]

1423
02:06:08.936 --> 02:06:10.520
[coughs]

1424
02:06:20.490 --> 02:06:21.782
We did it.

1425
02:07:06.661 --> 02:07:07.869
[Edwin] Hang on, boys.

1426
02:07:13.042 --> 02:07:15.043
- Thanks.
- Of course.

1427
02:07:15.128 --> 02:07:16.586
[Dick] Hey, Layton.

1428
02:07:16.671 --> 02:07:18.004
Hell of a job.

1429
02:07:21.884 --> 02:07:23.593
You boys really came through for us.

1430
02:07:27.098 --> 02:07:28.598
[coughs]

1431
02:07:53.207 --> 02:07:54.749
There's Daddy!

1432
02:07:56.502 --> 02:07:57.752
Come here, baby.

1433
02:08:04.177 --> 02:08:05.927
- Hey.
- Daddy! Daddy!

1434
02:08:07.305 --> 02:08:08.638
Hey, sweetie.

1435
02:08:12.101 --> 02:08:13.310
[coughs]

1436
02:08:13.769 --> 02:08:16.313
[sighs] Oh, thank God.

1437
02:08:17.482 --> 02:08:18.648
What happened?

1438
02:08:19.859 --> 02:08:22.736
Apparently, I inhaled caustic soda.

1439
02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:25.071
- What does that mean?
- My lungs are shot.

1440
02:08:25.156 --> 02:08:27.282
The Navy's never gonna let me fly again.

1441
02:08:28.284 --> 02:08:29.743
Well, get good at something else.

1442
02:08:29.827 --> 02:08:32.662
You have the rest of your life
to figure it out.

1443
02:08:33.539 --> 02:08:34.748
Oh.

1444
02:08:34.832 --> 02:08:35.832
[sighs]
