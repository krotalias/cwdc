## \mainpage VideoStore - A video store that rents games and DVDs.
#
# The purpose of this assignment is to give you some experience working with inheritance.
# In this homework, you will implement code for a simple video store.
# <br>
# A video store consists of a list of items (various kinds of games and DVDs) and a list of customers (people who can rent items):
# - Different kinds of items may have different policies for how long they may be rented, the cost of rental, and how late fees are calculated.
# - Different kinds of customers may have different behavior, when it comes to late fees or other aspects of renting and returning items.
#
# Please note that all cost amounts in the code are expressed in cents, e.g., where the spec says $1.50, your code would use the integer value 150.
#
# @section notes release.notes
# This program runs either in python 2.7 or python 3.6
#
# To run the program:
# - python VideoStore.py
#
## @package VideoStore
