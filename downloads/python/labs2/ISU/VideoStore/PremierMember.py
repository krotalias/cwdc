#  PremierMembers are allowed to rent items even if they currently have overdue items, and are
#  never charged late fees (though they still collect the early return bonus for new releases).
#  - Premier members accumulate 3 bonus points for each item returned on time. Ten bonus points
#  are worth 1.50.
#  - Each time they accumulate 10 bonus points, the bonus points are automatically
#  converted to a 1.50 credit on the customerâ€™s balance.
