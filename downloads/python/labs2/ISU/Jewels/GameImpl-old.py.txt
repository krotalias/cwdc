#
#  Game implementation.
#
#  Concrete implementation of the IGame interface. This implementation has the following behavior:
#  - Moves are allowed via the select() method for pairs of adjacent cells only. 
#    The cells must have different types. The move must create at least one run.
#  - A run is defined to be three or more adjacent cells of the same type, horizontally or vertically. 
#    A given cell may be part of a horizontal run or a vertical run at the same time.
#  - Points are awarded for runs based on their length. A run of length 3 is awarded BASE_SCORE points, 
#    and a run of length (3 + n) points gets @f$BASE\_SCORE \times 2^n@f$.
