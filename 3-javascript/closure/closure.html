            A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has
            access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables â€” a scope
            chain.
        </p>

        The closure has three scope chains. It has access:
        <ul>
            <li>
                to its own scope - variables defined between its curly brackets,
            </li>
            <li>to the outer function's variables,</li>
            <li>to the global variables.</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="output"></div>
        <script type="module">
            import { testClosure } from "./closure.js";
            document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = testClosure();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
