 * Summary.
 * &lt;p>A mail-delivery robot picking up and dropping off parcels.&lt;/p>
 *
 *  Description.
 *  &lt;p>The village of Meadowfield isn’t very big. &lt;/p>
 *  &lt;ul>
 *    &lt;li>It consists of 11 places with 14 roads between them.&lt;/li>
 *    &lt;li>It can be described with this array of roads:&lt;/li>
 *    &lt;br>
 *    const roads = [
 *    &lt;ul style="list-style-type:none">
 *      &lt;li> "Alice's House-Bob's House",   "Alice's House-Cabin", &lt;/li>
 *      &lt;li> "Alice's House-Post Office",   "Bob's House-Town Hall", &lt;/li>
 *      &lt;li> "Daria's House-Ernie's House", "Daria's House-Town Hall", &lt;/li>
 *      &lt;li> "Ernie's House-Grete's House", "Grete's House-Farm", &lt;/li>
 *      &lt;li> "Grete's House-Shop",          "Marketplace-Farm", &lt;/li>
 *      &lt;li> "Marketplace-Post Office",     "Marketplace-Shop", &lt;/li>
 *      &lt;li> "Marketplace-Town Hall",       "Shop-Town Hall" &lt;/li>
 *    &lt;/ul>
 *    ]
 *  &lt;/ul>
 *
 * &lt;p>The village's road network (topology) will be represented by a graph. &lt;/p>
 * Each node of the graph represents a place, which is associated with its set of edges,&lt;br>
 * that is, the set of {@link module:07a_robot.roadGraph roads} emanating from it.

 * &lt;p>Look at short routes before we look at longer ones.

 * exploring every reachable place that hasn’t been visited yet, until a route reaches the goal.&lt;br>
 * That way, we’ll only explore routes that are potentially interesting, and we’ll find the shortest route&lt;br>
 * (or one of the shortest routes, if there are more than one) to the goal.&lt;/p>
 *
 * &lt;p>Basically, this is a breath-first traversal until the destination node is reached.
 * Therefore, it is kept a work list (a queue). &lt;br>
 * This is an array of places that should be explored next, along with the route that got us there.
 * It starts with just the start position and an empty route. &lt;/p>
 *
 *
 * &lt;p>The search then operates by taking the next item in the list and exploring that,
 * which means all roads going from that place are looked at.&lt;br>
 * If one of them is the goal, a finished route can be returned.
 * Otherwise, if we haven’t looked at this place before, a new item is added to the list.&lt;br>
 * If we have looked at it before, since we are looking at short routes first,
 * we’ve found either a longer route to that place or one precisely,&lt;br>
 * as long as the existing one, and we don’t need to explore it.&lt;/p>
 *
 * &lt;p>You can visually imagine this as a web of known routes crawling out from the start location,
 * growing evenly on all sides (but never tangling back into itself).&lt;br>
