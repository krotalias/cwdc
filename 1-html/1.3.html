--- Network Layers ---

HTTP is a protocol used mostly for browsing the internet (i.e., Firefox, Chrome, etc). 
It rides on top of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which provides a reliable link between two computers 
(that is, if packet get lost - it is re-transmitted). 

TCP itself rides on top of IP (Internet Protocol), which provides unified addressing to communicate between computers.
TCP/IP is a basis for internet and 99% of other networks.

Formally, TCP is a transport-layer protocol, and HTTP is an application-layer protocol that runs over TCP.

The User Datagram Protocol (UDP), on the other hand, is another core member of the Internet protocol suite. 
Although unreliable, and with no guarantee packages will arrive in the correct order, it can be used for streaming for example, 
or in applications where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application.
