                    A dive bomber is a bomber aircraft that dives directly at
                    its targets in order to provide greater accuracy for the
                    bomb it drops. Diving towards the target simplifies the
                    bomb's trajectory and allows the pilot to keep visual
                    contact throughout the bomb run. This allows attacks on
                    point targets and ships, which were difficult to attack with
                    conventional level bombers, even en masse. Glide bombing is
                    a similar technique using shallower dive angles that does
                    not require a sharp pull-up after dropping the bombs. This
                    can be performed by larger aircraft and fighter bombers but
                    does not confer the same level of accuracy as a steep dive
                    from a dedicated aircraft.

                        It was manufactured by Douglas Aircraft from 1940
                        through 1944.

                        During its combat service, the SBD proved to be an
                        excellent naval scout plane and dive bomber.

                    <li>
                        The SBD is best remembered as the bomber that delivered
                        the fatal blows to the Japanese carriers at the Battle
                        of Midway in June 1942.
