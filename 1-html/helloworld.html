<p>Youtube ___ share ___ embed (copyright issues, sometimes)</p>
<p>YouTube provides an "Embed" option under the share buttons of its videos.</p>
<p>
    By offering this option, YouTube effectively gives a green light to users to
    embed videos on their websites or platforms, as long as the original
    uploader has allowed embedding.
</p>
<p>
    However, ensure the content in the video itself isn't violating copyright
    rules.
