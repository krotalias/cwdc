                The Three Stooges were an American vaudeville and comedy team
                active from 1922 until 1970, best known for their 190 short
                subject films by Columbia Pictures that have been regularly
                airing on television since 1958. Their hallmark was physical
                farce and slapstick. Six Stooges appeared over the act's run
                (with only three active at any given time): Moe Howard (t/n
                Moses Horwitz) and Larry Fine (t/n Larry Feinberg) were
                mainstays throughout the ensemble's nearly 50-year run and the
                pivotal "third stooge" was played by (in order of appearance)
                Shemp Howard (t/n Samuel Horwitz), Curly Howard (t/n Jerome
                Horwitz), Shemp Howard again, Joe Besser and "Curly" Joe DeRita.
            </p>
            <p>
                The act began in the early 1920s as part of a vaudeville comedy
                act billed as "Ted Healy and His Stooges", consisting originally
                of Healy and Moe Howard. Over time, they were joined by Moe's
                brother Shemp Howard, and then Larry Fine. The four appeared in
                one feature film, Soup to Nuts, before Shemp left to pursue a
                solo career. He was replaced by his and Moe's younger brother,
                Jerome "Curly" Howard, in 1932. Two years later, after appearing
                in several movies, the trio left Healy and signed on to appear
                in their own short-subject comedies for Columbia Pictures, now
                billed as "The Three Stooges". From 1934 to 1946, Moe, Larry and
                Curly produced over 90 short films for Columbia. It was during
                this period that the three were at their peak popularity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Curly suffered a debilitating stroke in May 1946, and Shemp
                returned, reconstituting the original lineup, until his death of
                a heart attack on November 22, 1955. Film actor Joe Palma was
                used as a stand-in to complete four Shemp-era shorts under
                contract. This procedure – disguising one actor for another
                outside of stunt shots – became known as the "fake Shemp".
                Columbia contract player Joe Besser joined as the third Stooge
                for two years (1956–57), departing in 1958 to nurse his ill wife
                after Columbia terminated its shorts division. The studio then
                released all the shorts via Screen Gems, Columbia's television
                studio and distribution unit. Screen Gems then syndicated the
                shorts to television, whereupon the Stooges became one of the
                most popular comedy acts of the early 1960s.
            </p>
            <p>
                Comic actor Joe DeRita became "Curly Joe" in 1958, replacing
                Besser for a new series of full-length theatrical films. With
                intense television exposure, the act regained momentum
                throughout the 1960s as popular kids' fare, until Fine's
                paralyzing stroke in the midst of filming a pilot for a Three
                Stooges TV series in January 1970. Fine died in 1975 after a
                further series of strokes. Attempts were made to revive the
                Stooges with longtime supporting actor Emil Sitka in Fine's role
                in 1970, and again in 1975, but this attempt was cut short by
                Moe Howard's death on May 4, 1975.
