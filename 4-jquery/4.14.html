            <h3>Mitsubishi Zero</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    When the Zero was first introduced into the war, it was
                    considered the absolute standard in carrier-based fighters,
                    combining both long range and maneuverability. During the
                    early part of the war, it became the most feared dogfighter
                    of all of the aircraft in existence. Its average
                    kill-to-death ratio was 12 to 1. But by 1943, the
                    introduction of better equipment and tactics made it, where
                    the Allied pilots could compete with the Zero. The IJNAS
                    would also use the Zero as a land-based fighter. In 1943,
                    the weaknesses of the Zero were really starting to show, and
                    it could no longer compete against the newer planes coming
                    in with their greater speed, firepower, armor and their
                    ability to match its maneuverability. Even though the Zero
                    was outdated by 1944, the plane was still in use on the
                    front lines, because of newer designs being pushed back and
                    the Japanese having production difficulties. During the
                    final years of World War II, the Zero was even used in
                    kamikaze missions. The Zero was the most produced aircraft
                    for the Japanese during World War II.

            <h3>Spitfire</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The Spitfire is most likely the most famous aircraft from
                    the World War II era. It was the king of low-altitudes. It
                    will be known forever as the plane that turned the tide in
                    the Battle of Britain. It’s main foe in that battle was the
                    109, but the Spitfire made the Germans stay low with their
                    bombers, which was not ideal for the 109, but it was perfect
                    for the Spitfire. In the Battle of Britain, the Spitfire
                    gained fame by having the highest victory-to-loss ratio
                    among British aircraft. Bob Tuck (27 kills), Johnnie Johnson
                    (34 kills), and Douglas Bader (20 Kills), were the ace
                    fighters in that battle. The Spitfire was also the most
                    produced fighter for the British, and was continuously
                    produced throughout the war.

            <h3>P-47 Thunderbolt</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The Thunderbolt was one of the heaviest and largest fighter
                    planes ever built; it was also only powered by a single
                    piston engine. It was only built from 1941-1945 and was
                    equipped with eight .50-calibre machine guns, four per wing,
                    which were absolutely devastating. When it had a full
                    payload, the Thunderbolt weighed around 8 tons; it would
                    carry five-inch rockets or just a single bomb that weighed
                    2,500 pounds; it could even carry over half of the B-17
                    which was insane for a fighter plane. It even out killed the
                    P-51 Mustang during the first three months of 1944, having
                    540 kills to the Mustang’s 389, but eventually the Mustang
                    over took it in kills, 972 for the Mustang and 409 for the
                    P-47, in the second quarter of the year. The Thunderbolt
                    even flew more attack missions than the P-51s, P-40s and
                    P-38s combined. Not only was the Thunderbolt one of the main
                    fighters for the U.S. in World War II, but also served with
                    the British, French, and Russians. Brazilian and Mexican
                    squadrons were given the P-47 instead. The cockpit was roomy
                    and very comfortable, and the pilot had an amazing line of
                    sight. Even today, the Thunderbolt name lives on with the
                    Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II.

            <h3>P-38 Lightning</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Want to know about one of the greatest Allied fighters ever?
                    How about two turbocharged engines, range, firepower, and
                    the best aerodynamics of the era, made the P-38 one of the
                    top choices ever. Its only drawback was its altitude
                    capabilities, but even still, it dominated the Pacific. The
                    P-38 with its iconic twin booms and a central nacelle
                    containing the cockpit and armament, was nicknamed the
                    “fork-tailed devil” by the Luftwaffe, and “two planes, one
                    pilot” by the Japanese. The P-38 had many roles which
                    included dive bombing, ground-attack, level bombing,
                    interception, recon, night fighting, evacuation mission,
                    radar and visual pathfinding for bombers, and long-range
                    fighting. The P-38 saw most of its success in the Pacific
                    and China-Burma-India Operations; it was used by the U.S.’
                    top ace pilots, Charles H. MacDonald (36 victories), Thomas
                    McGuire (38 victories) and Richard Bong (40 Victories). The
                    P-38 was the main fighter in the Southwest Pacific Theater,
                    until a large force of P-51D Mustangs was brought in towards
                    the end of the war.

            <h3>P-51 Mustang</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The P-51 Mustang Fighter, a North American Aviation, is one
                    of the most iconic fighter / fighter bombers that is
                    single-seated, and was used during World War 2. In total
                    over 15,000 of these were manufactured. The Mustang was
                    designed originally to be used with the Allison V-1710
                    engine – making it a very good aircraft. When the B & C
                    models were made of the P-51, they added a Rolls Royce
                    Merlin engine, and this completely transformed its
                    performance at high altitude (15,000+ feet), which meant it
                    matched or even bettered that of the Luftwaffe’s fighters.
                    The final version of the P-51 was the P-51D, and this was
                    powered by yet another engine, the Packard V-1650-7, and was
                    fully armed with .50 caliber M2 machine guns (6 in total on
                    each aircraft). From late in 1943, P-51’s were used to
                    escort bombers in raids over occupied Europe and over
                    Germany, all the way to Berlin. The P-51’s with the Merlin
                    engines were also used as fighter-bombers, which made sure
                    that the Allied ruled supreme in the air in 1944. The P-51
                    was also used in service with Allied air forces in Italian,
                    Mediterranean and North African areas of service, and also
                    saw action in the Pacific War against the Japanese. Within
                    World War 2, P-51 pilots claim to have shot down 4,950 enemy
                    aircraft.

            <h3>Messerschmitt Bf 109</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    If you look at Aviation history, then you will see that the
                    109 was one of the best planes of all time. It even rivaled
                    the British Spitfire, which is an amazing feat. It was
                    graceful in the air as a dancer, and no other plane could
                    even touch it in high altitudes. However, when it
                    accompanied bombers over Great Britain, it usually fought at
                    low altitudes, which it was not made for. It carried 20mm
                    cannons, and it would become the most important fighter
                    plane in the Luftwaffe. The 109 was a German World War II
                    fighter aircraft designed by two men by the names of Robert
                    Lusser and Willy Messerschmitt during the 1930s. The 109 was
                    one of the only true modern planes in the war; it included
                    features such as a retractable landing gear, all-metal
                    monocoque construction, and a closed canopy. It was actually
                    powered by a liquid-cooled, inverted-V12 Aero engine. It was
                    first used in the Spanish Civil war and even stayed in use
                    until the dawn of the fighter age near the end of World War
                    II; it was still the backbone of the Luftwaffe’s Fighter
                    Force. Slowly but surely it was being replaced by the
                    superior Focke-Wulf Fw 190. The original plan for the 109
                    was for it to be an interceptor, but later models were built
                    for a variety of tasks: fighter-bomber, day-fighter,
                    night-fighter, all-weather fighter, recon plane,
                    ground-attack aircraft, and of course a bomber escort. The
                    109 was the most produced fighter in history. There were
                    produced a total of 33,984 airframes from 1936-1945.

            <h3>Focke-Wulf Fw-190</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The 190 is literally one of the best fighters of all time,
                    no Allied plane that fought against it will ever forget what
                    it could do. It was introduced in 1941; the fighter almost
                    immediately started to tear through the RAF and was putting
                    down major punishment of Allied bombers. The 190 was highly
                    respected by all the Allied pilots and it was a perfect
                    fighter, fighter-bomber, and anti-tank aircraft.
                    Oberleutnant Otto Kittel – who was an amazing pilot – scored
                    almost all of his 267 killed in a 190. The 190 was a
                    single-engine, single-seat fighter designed by Kurt Tank. It
                    had a counterpart, the Messerschmitt Bf 109, but the 190
                    became the backbone of the Luftwaffe’s Jagdwaffe (Fighter
                    Force). It was powered by a BMW engine and because of this,
                    it was able to lift larger loads than the 109. It also
                    allowed it to be used as a night-fighter, day-fighter,
                    ground-attack aircraft and fighter-bomber.
