<p>
Many JavaScript libraries use $ as a function or variable name, just as jQuery does. <br>
In jQuery's case, $ is just an alias for jQuery, so all functionality is available without using $. <br>
If you need to use another JavaScript library alongside jQuery, return control of $ back to the other library with a call to <a href="https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/">$.noConflict()</a>. <br>
Old references of $ are saved during jQuery initialization; noConflict() simply restores them.
<p>
If for some reason two versions of jQuery are loaded (which is not recommended), <br>
calling $.noConflict( true ) from the second version will return the globally scoped jQuery variables to those of the first version.</p>
