<p>
jQuery was created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Resig">John Resig</a>
and it is used by 77% of the 10 million most popular websites, <br />
having at least 3 to 4 times more usage than any other JavaScript library.
</p>

<p>
Many JavaScript libraries use $ as a function or variable name, just as jQuery does. <br />
In jQuery's case, $ is just an alias for jQuery, so all functionality is available without using $. <br />
If you need to use another JavaScript library alongside jQuery, return control of $ back to the other library with a call to
<a href="https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/">$.noConflict()</a>. <br />
Old references of $ are saved during jQuery initialization; noConflict() simply restores them.
</p>

<p>
If for some reason two versions of jQuery are loaded (which is not recommended), <br />
calling $.noConflict(true) from the second version will return the globally scoped
jQuery variables to those of the first version.
