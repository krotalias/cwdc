                    On June 12, 1940, Kartveli submitted the redesigned AP-10 to
                    the USAAC. The new aircraft was much larger than the
                    original, and the inline engine was swapped for a
                    turbo-supercharged Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp
                    18-cylinder radial engine. Armament was increased to eight
                    M2 Brownings, four mounted in each wing, making it one of
                    the heaviest-armed fighter considered by the USAAC at the
                    time. The expected performance met USAAC requirements,
                    however, its fuel load fell slightly short. Despite this,
                    the USAAC ordered a prototype of the improved design as the
                    XP-47B, on September 6, 1940.

                    <p>P-47C</p>
                    Several improvements were incorporated into the Thunderbolt
                    starting with the 172nd production aircraft on September 14,
                    1942. The resulting P-47C featured a redesigned metal
                    rudder, as the original fabric-covered unit was prone to
                    tail flutter which frequently led to crashes.A revised
                    oxygen system was fitted, as were new SCR-274-N and
                    SCR-515-A radios. The main external difference between the
                    P-47B and C was the upright antenna mast, which replaced the
                    B's forward-swept mast. The C variant was built in four
                    production blocks totaling 602 aircraft, with production
                    ending in February 1943 when Republic's Farmingdale, New
                    York plant switched to the P-47D.

                    </p>
                    On October 14, 1941, the USAAF (successor to the USAAC)
                    ordered an additional 850 P-47s. Unable to keep up with the
                    demand with their main plant in Farmingdale, New York,
                    Republic built a new plant in Evansville, Indiana.
                    Production of P-47Cs in the new plant were designated
                    P-47D-RA, with the first aircraft rolling off the production
                    line in September 1942. The initial production block was
                    based on the P-47C-2-RE or C-5-RE, but with two additional
                    cowl flaps (for a total of five) on each side (this was
                    absent on early aircraft, making them indistinguishable from
                    P-47Cs). Internal changes included extra cockpit armor and
                    changes to the turbo-supercharger exhaust system.
                    Eventually, these changes would be incorporated into the
                    Farmingdale-built aircraft, these designated P-47D-1-RE. 21
                    production blocks of the "razorback" P-47D, totaling 9,530
                    aircraft, would be built by both plants before production
                    switched to the "bubbletop" D-variant.

                    Even with the second plant, Republic was still having
                    trouble keeping up with the ever increasing orders for
                    Thunderbolts. Curtiss-Wright, which recently prepared its
                    Buffalo, New York plant for mass production of its P-60A
                    before their contract was canceled, was awarded another
                    contract to produce the P-47 as the P-47G. The first
                    delivery of a Curtiss-Wright-built P-47G was in December
                    1942. In all, Curtiss-Wright built 354 P-47Gs in five
                    production blocks before production ended in March 1944.

                <div class="flexbox-item">
                    <p>XP-47H</p>
                    In an attempt to improve the performance of the Thunderbolt,
                    Republic began a project to install a 2,300 hp Chrysler
                    XIV-2220-1 16-cylinder inverted-V engine in two P-47D-15-RE
                    airframes in August 1943. The resulting XP-47H had a new
                    streamlined nose with a large intake and was expected to
                    have a maximum speed of 490 mph. While sources do not agree
                    whether the aircraft met the speed expectations or fell
                    short, by the time the aircraft were modified in 1945, the
                    Jet Age was beginning and the USAAF was losing interest in
                    piston-engined fighters, and the XP-47H project was
                    canceled.

                <div class="flexbox-item">
                    <p>XP-47J</p>
                    A similar attempt to improve performance resulted in the
                    XP-47J. Unlike the XP-47H, the sole XP-47J was a newly built
                    airframe, with many changes to reduce weight. The aircraft
                    was fitted with a 2,800 hp R-2800-57C engine with a CH-5
                    supercharger, housed in a redesigned streamlined cowling.
                    Armament was reduced to six M2 Brownings.<br />

                    The XP-47J was first flown on November 26, 1943, and on
                    August 4, 1944, it became the first piston-engined fighter
                    to exceed 500 mph, with a speed of 504 mph, making it the
                    fastest Thunderbolt variant. A production version of the
                    XP-47J was canceled in favor of another Thunderbolt
                    development, the XP-72, as were plans for installing an
                    R-2800-61 engine with contra-rotating propellers.
