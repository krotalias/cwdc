            <h2>D Day</h2>

            During World War II (1939-1945), the Battle of Normandy, which
            lasted from June 1944 to August 1944, resulted in the Allied
            liberation of Western Europe from Nazi Germany’s control. Codenamed
            Operation Overlord, the battle began on June 6, 1944, also known as
            D-Day, when some 156,000 American, British and Canadian forces
            landed on five beaches along a 50-mile stretch of the heavily
            fortified coast of France’s Normandy region. The invasion was one of
            the largest amphibious military assaults in history and required
            extensive planning. Prior to D-Day, the Allies conducted a
            large-scale deception campaign designed to mislead the Germans about
            the intended invasion target. By late August 1944, all of northern
            France had been liberated, and by the following spring the Allies
            had defeated the Germans. The Normandy landings have been called the
            beginning of the end of war in Europe.<br /><br />

            <h2>Preparing for D-Day</h2>

            After World War II began, Germany invaded and occupied northwestern
            France beginning in May 1940. The Americans entered the war in
            December 1941, and by 1942 they and the British (who had been
            evacuated from the beaches of Dunkirk in May 1940 after being cut
            off by the Germans in the Battle of France) were considering the
            possibility of a major Allied invasion across the English Channel.
            The following year, Allied plans for a cross-Channel invasion began
            to ramp up. In November 1943, Adolf Hitler (1889-1945), who was
            aware of the threat of an invasion along France’s northern coast,
            put Erwin Rommel (1891-1944) in charge of spearheading defense
            operations in the region, even though the Germans did not know
            exactly where the Allies would strike. Hitler charged Rommel with
            finishing the Atlantic Wall, a 2,400-mile fortification of bunkers,
            landmines and beach and water obstacles.<br /><br />

            In January 1944, General Dwight Eisenhower (1890-1969) was appointed
            commander of Operation Overlord. In the months and weeks before
            D-Day, the Allies carried out a massive deception operation intended
            to make the Germans think the main invasion target was Pas-de-Calais
            (the narrowest point between Britain and France) rather than
            Normandy. In addition, they led the Germans to believe that Norway
            and other locations were also potential invasion targets. Many
            tactics were used to carry out the deception, including fake
            equipment; a phantom army commanded by George Patton and supposedly
            based in England, across from Pas-de-Calais; double agents; and
            fraudulent radio transmissions.

            <h2>A Weather Delay: June 5, 1944</h2>

            Eisenhower selected June 5, 1944, as the date for the invasion;
            however, bad weather on the days leading up to the operation caused
            it to be delayed for 24 hours. On the morning of June 5, after his
            meteorologist predicted improved conditions for the following day,
            Eisenhower gave the go-ahead for Operation Overlord. He told the
            troops: “You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward
            which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are
            upon you.”<br /><br />

            Later that day, more than 5,000 ships and landing craft carrying
            troops and supplies left England for the trip across the Channel to
            France, while more than 11,000 aircraft were mobilized to provide
            air cover and support for the invasion.
