<p><b>For educational purposes only.</b></p>
<p>This is a <b><a href="../images/mapViewer.mp4">demo</a></b> for teaching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics">CG</a>,
which became <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhiCFdWeQfA">overly complicated</a>,
and it is similar to <a href="/cwdc/13-webgl/examples/lighting/content/doc-lighting2/index.html">Lighting2</a>,
except we define a 3x3 matrix for <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Materials">material properties</a>
and a 3x3 matrix for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial/Lighting_in_WebGL">light properties</a>
that are passed to the fragment shader as
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/uniform">uniforms</a>.

Edit the <a href="global.html#lightPropElements">light</a> and <a href="global.html#matPropElements">material</a> matrices in the global variables to experiment or
<a href="global.html#startForReal">startForReal</a> to choose a model and select
<a href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-shading/shading-normals">face or vertex normals</a>.
<a href="https://threejs.org">Three.js</a> only uses face normals for
<a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/PolyhedronGeometry">polyhedra</a>, indeed.<p>

Texture coordinates can be set in each model or <a href="https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/197931/how-can-i-correctly-map-a-texture-onto-a-sphere">sampled at each pixel</a>
in the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krotalias/cwdc/main/13-webgl/extras/LightingWithTexture.html">fragment shader</a>.
We can also approximate a sphere by subdividing a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron">convex regular polyhedron</a> and solving Mipmapping artifact issues
by using <a href="https://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publications/2012/Tar12/jgt_tarini.pdf">Tarini's</a> method, in this case.
These <a href="https://bgolus.medium.com/distinctive-derivative-differences-cce38d36797b">artifacts</a>
show up due to the discontinuity in the seam when crossing the line with 0 radians on one side and 2π on the other.
Some triangles may have edges that cross this line, causing the wrong mipmap level 0 to be chosen.

<p>To lay a map onto a sphere, textures should have an aspect ratio of 2:1 for equirectangular projections
or 1:1 (squared) for Mercator projections. Finding high-resolution, good-quality,
and free <a href="https://www.axismaps.com/guide/map-projections">cartographic maps</a>
is really difficult.</p>

<p>Maps are transformations from <a href="module-polyhedron.html#.cartesian2Spherical">3D space</a>
to <a href="module-polyhedron.html#.spherical2Mercator">2D space</a>, and they can preserve areas
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-area_projection">equal-area maps</a>) or angles
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map">conformal maps</a>). The success of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">Mercator projection</a>
lies in its ability to preserve angles, making it ideal for navigation
(directions on the map match the directions on the compass). However, it distorts areas,
especially near the poles, where landmasses appear <a href="https://math.uit.no/ansatte/dennis/MoMS2017-Lec3.pdf">much larger</a>
than they are in reality. Meridian and parallel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map)">scales</a>
are the same, meaning that distances along a parallel or meridian (in fact, in all directions) are equally stretched
by a factor of sec(φ) = 1/cos(φ), where φ ∈ [-85.051129°, 85.051129°] is its latitude.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection">Web Mercator</a>
projection, on the other hand, is a variant of the Mercator projection, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps">widely</a>
used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_mapping">web mapping</a> applications.
It was designed to work well with the Web Mercator coordinate system,
which is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#WGS_84">WGS 84 datum</a>.

The projection is neither strictly ellipsoidal nor strictly spherical,
and it uses spherical development of ellipsoidal coordinates.
The underlying geographic coordinates are defined using the WGS 84 ellipsoidal model
of the Earth's surface but are projected as if
<a href="https://alastaira.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/the-google-maps-bing-maps-spherical-mercator-projection/">defined on a sphere</a>.

Misinterpreting Web Mercator for the standard Mercator during coordinate conversion can lead to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329065451/https://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/web_mercator/index.html">deviations</a>
as much as 40 km on the ground.</p>

<p>It is impressive how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardus_Mercator">Gerardus Mercator</a> was able to create such a projection in a
<a href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~israel/m103/mercator/mercator.html">time</a> (1569) when there was no
calculus (integrals, derivatives — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_calculus">Leibniz-Newton</a>, 1674-1666) or even logarithm tables
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Napier">John Napier</a>, 1614).</p>

<a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/mercator-its-not-hip-to-be-square/">Mercator texture coordinates</a>
can be set in a <a href="module-polyhedron.html#.setMercatorCoordinates">model</a> directly or in
the <a href="../../showCode.php?f=extras/LightingWithTexture">shader</a>
that samples texture coordinates for each pixel.

Since a unit sphere fits in the WebGL <a href="https://carmencincotti.com/2022-11-28/from-clip-space-to-ndc-space/">NDC space</a>,
it is possible to go into each fragment from:
<ul>
  <li> cartesian → spherical (equirectangular) → Mercator </li>
  <li> (x, y, z) → (long, lat) → (x, y) </li>
  <li> sample texture at (x, y)</li>
</ul>

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection">equirectangular projection</a>,
also known as the equidistant cylindrical projection (e.g., plate carrée),
is a way of representing the Earth's surface on a flat plane, and
maps longitude and latitude lines into straight, evenly spaced lines,
essentially flattening the sphere into a rectangle.

<p>Its meridian scale is 1 meaning that the distance along lines of longitude
remains the same across the map, while its parallel
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map)">scale</a> varies with latitude,
which means that the distance along lines of latitude is stretched by a factor of sec(φ).

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> claims that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinus_of_Tyre">Marinus of Tyre</a>
invented the projection in the first century (AD 100).
The projection is neither equal area nor conformal.
In particular, the plate carrée (<em>flat square</em>) has become a standard for
<a href="https://gisgeography.com/best-free-gis-data-sources-raster-vector/">global raster datasets</a>.</p>

<p><u>As a final remark</u>, I thought it would be easier to deal with map images as textures, but I was mistaken. I tried, as long as I could,
not to rewrite third-party code. Unfortunately, this was impossible. The main issue was that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian">prime meridian</a> is
at the center of a map image and not at its border, which corresponds to
its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180th_meridian">antimeridian</a>. </p>

<p>Initially, I used the <a href="https://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/demos/script/basic-object-models-IFS.js">basic-object-models-IFS</a> package,
but the models had their z-axis pointing up as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith">zenith</a>,
and I wanted the y-axis to be the north pole (up).
Therefore, I switched to <a href="global.html#getModelData">Three.js</a>, and almost everything
worked just fine. Nonetheless, a sphere created by subdividing a <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/PolyhedronGeometry">polyhedron</a>
had its <a href="module-polyhedron.html#.rotateUTexture">texture coordinates</a> rotated by 180°
and a cylinder or cone by 90°. In fact, there is a poorly documented parameter,
<a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/ConeGeometry">thetaStart</a>, that <u>does fix</u> just that.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I decided to adapt the <a href="https://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/">hws</a> software
to my needs by introducing a global hook, <a href="global.html#yNorth">yNorth</a>,
and <a href="global.html#setNorth">rotating</a> the models accordingly. Furthermore, I added the parameter <u>stacks</u> to <a href="global.html#uvCone">uvCone</a> and <a href="global.html#uvCylinder">uvCylinder</a>,
to improve interpolation and fixed the number of triangles generated in uvCone. This way, the set of models in hws and
three.js became quite similar, although I kept the "<i>zig-zag</i>" mesh for cones and cylinders in hws
(I have no idea whether it provides any practical advantage).
A user can switch between hws and three.js models by pressing a single key (Alt, ❖ or ⌘) in the interface.</p>

<p>There is a lot of redundancy in the form of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36179507/three-js-spherebuffergeometry-why-so-many-vertices">vertex duplication</a>
in all of these models that precludes mipmapping artifacts.
The theoretical number of vertices, <mark>𝑣</mark>, for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold">manifold model</a>
and the actual number of vertices (🔴) are <a href="global.html#createModel">displayed</a> in the interface.
The number of edges, <i>e</i>, is simply three times the number of triangles, <i>t</i>, divided by two.</p>

For any triangulation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology)">compact surface</a>,
the <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/9780387902715">following holds</a> (page=52):
<ul>
<li><i>2e = 3t</i>,</li>
<li><i>e = 3(<mark>𝑣</mark> - <a href="../doc/Eulers_Map_Theorem.pdf">χ</a>), χ(S²)=2</i>,</li>
<li>𝑣 &ge; 1/2 (7 + √(49 - 24χ)).</li>
</ul>

<p>As a proof of concept, I implemented a <a href="global.html#uvSphereND">sphere</a> model without any vertex duplication.
Besides being much harder to code, its last slice (e.g., slices = 48) goes from 6.152285613280011 (2π/48 * 47) to 0.0
and not 2π (if there was an extra duplicate vertex), which generates texture coordinates
going from 0.9791666666666666 (47/48) to 0.0 and not 1.0.
Although this discontinuity is what causes the mipmapping artifacts, it has nothing to do with the topology of the model
but how mipmapping is <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems2/part-iii-high-quality-rendering/chapter-28-mipmap-level-measurement">implemented</a> on the GPU.

However, since an entire line is mapped onto the vextex at the north or south pole,
and a vertex can have only one pair of texture coordinates (u,v),
no matter what value we use for the "u" coordinate (e.g., 0 or 0.5),
the interpolation will produce an awkward swirl effect at the poles.</p>

Of course, these are just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh">polygon meshes</a> suitable for visualization
and not valid topological <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation">B-rep</a>
models that enforce the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Euler-characteristic">Euler characteristic</a>

<p><b>The application</b>: Around The World in <a href="../images/Brazil.mp4">373 historical figures</a>.</p>
<p>When I was a child and forced to study history, I was never able to visualize the actual location of an event.
For instance, where were the locations of Thrace, Anatolia, Troy, the Parthian Empire, the Inca Empire, and Rapa Nui?</p>

<p>Therefore, I have always wanted to present, in a graphical way, the connection between historical events in time and space.
I think I have been able to implement a reasonable application for doing just that. However, how I implemented it is not the main point.
For not using any npm packages or bundlers, I decided to stick only with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebGL,
plus some packages, including three.js.</p>

<p>The documentation is extensive because I aimed to use it in an introductory computer graphics course.
However, I have come to realize that computer graphics has become a commodity, much like database management;
everyone utilizes it, yet very few people are interested in understanding the underlying mechanics.
This trend poses a challenge for educators, as it becomes increasingly important to
inspire curiosity and a deeper appreciation for the artistic and technical aspects of graphics programming.
By focusing on foundational principles, I hope to encourage students to explore beyond the surface and engage
with the creative possibilities that computer graphics offers.</p>

<p>Of course, everything could have been implemented using three.js only,
although I am not sure OrbitControls would give me the flexibility I needed to build the interface.
Exploring alternative libraries and frameworks could provide additional tools and features
that enhance the user experience and streamline development.
Ultimately, the goal is to create an environment where students feel empowered to experiment and innovate,
pushing the boundaries of what they can achieve in graphics programming.</p>

<p>I used no AI, and for three or four months when I woke up, I picked up an event and read a lot of material, mainly Wikipedia,
for dating the events associated with a site. As a consequence, it is clear to me now that I know very little about Africa and Australia.
This realization has sparked a desire in me to delve deeper into the histories and cultures of these regions.
I plan to explore diverse resources, including books, documentaries, and discussions with knowledgeable individuals,
to gain a more comprehensive understanding of their rich narratives.</p>

<p>It is possible to cycle through the historical figures by country when
choosing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">two letter</a> ISO country code in the interface.
For example, selecting "BR" will display all the figures from
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRZoIE-D2ke/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">Brazil</a>,
while "US" will show those from the
<A href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRHM2NHj7O_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">United States of America</a>.

The sorting of dates uses the day, month and year of the last date of the last entry
in the <a href="/cwdc/13-webgl/extras/locations.json">remarkable list</a> field.
E.g., "The Blitz (Battle of Britain), 10 July 1940 - 11 May 1941" is sorted using "10 July 1940".</p>

<p>Dates should be preceded by a comma in the remarkable list
field to be considered for sorting (no error checking is done). Examples:
<pre>
 , 324                       (1 0 324)
 , 657 BC                    (1 0 -657)
 , 330-1453                  (1 0 330)
 , 10 July 1940 - May 1941   (10 6 1940)
 , 15 July 1099              (15 6 1099)
</pre>

<li>The application displays the
<a href="/cwdc/13-webgl/extras/locations.json">location</a> (when its name is checked in the interface)
of a <a href="global.html#gpsCoordinates">city</a>
as the intersection of its line of latitude (parallel) and line of longitude (meridian) on the model surface (preferably a map onto a sphere).
Your task is to pick a point in the texture image (using the mouse or any pointer device) and display its location
on the texture image (map) and on the 3D model.
<ul>
  <li>To do this, you need to convert the screen coordinates of the mouse pointer into texture coordinates (u, v), then
  into <a href="global.html#spherical2gcs">GCS</a> coordinates (longitude, latitude) using the <a href="global.html#currentLocation">currentLocation</a>, and
  optionally <a href="module-polyhedron.html#.spherical2Mercator">transforming</a> them to Mercator coordinates.</li>
  <li>To draw the lines, use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineTo">lineTo()</a> from
      HTML5 by placing an element &lt;canvas&gt; on top of the element &ltimg&gt.</li>
  <li>This is simple to accomplish by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14824747/overlay-html5-canvas-over-image">nesting</a>
      the &lt;canvas&gt; element with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position">position</a>
      absolute in a &lt;div&gt; element with position relative and the <a href="global.html#newTexture">same size</a> as the image element.</li>
  <li>The &lt;canvas&gt; element should have a higher <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index">z-index</a>
      than the image element and ignore
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events">pointer events</a>.</li>
   <li>Finally, define a <a href="global.html#event:pointerdown-textimg">pointerdown</a> event handler to set
       the <a href="global.html#currentLocation">currentLocation</a> as the <a href="global.html#gpsCoordinates">gpsCoordinates</a> "Unknown" and draw the lines
       by calling <a href="global.html#drawLinesOnImage">drawLinesOnImage</a> in <a href="global.html#draw">draw</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>A bigger challenge would be to pick the point directly onto the model's surface, but you'll have to implement a 3D pick in this case
    by casting a ray, <a href="global.html#unproject">unprojecting</a> it, and finding its closest
    (first) intersection (relative to the viewer) with the polygonal surface of the model.</li>
<ul>
 <li>The easiest way is shooting the ray from the mouse position and <a href="global.html#pixelRayIntersection">intersecting</a>
     it against the surface of an implicit sphere
     by <a href="global.html#lineSphereIntersection">solving</a> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93sphere_intersection">second-degree equation</a>.</li>
 <li>The other way is to intersect the ray against each face of the polygonal surface by testing if the ray intersects the plane
     of a face and then checking if the intersection point is inside the corresponding triangle.</li>
 <li>We select a position on the globe by <a href="global.html#event:pointerdown-theCanvas">clicking</a> a mouse button in the WebGL canvas.</li>
 <li>To display the <a href="global.html#GCS">GCS</a> coordinates of the pointer while the globe is spinning, we need to keep track of the
    <a href="global.html#cursorPosition">cursor position</a>
    and then shoot a ray through this position to find its <a href="global.html#pixelRayIntersection">intersection</a> on the globe.</li>
 <li>Because a <a href="global.html#isTouchDevice">touch device</a> does not have a cursor position, we can use the Phong <a href="global.html#phongHighlight">highlight</a>
     position on the globe as a cursor.
     To do this, we need to know the initial position of the highlight in world coordinates
     (0, 0, 1)—or in <a href="global.html#GCS">GCS</a> coordinates (-90°, 0°)—and then transform it into <a href="global.html#gcs2Screen">screen coordinates</a>.</li>
<li>
 To exhibit a location name in 3D, it is necessary to <a href="global.html#project">transform</a> its
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/informix-servers/12.10.0?topic=data-geographic-coordinate-system">GCS</a> coordinates
into <a href="https://olegvaraksin.medium.com/convert-world-to-screen-coordinates-and-vice-versa-in-webgl-c1d3f2868086">screen coordinates</a>
(pixels) and use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position">position</a>
HTML properties "top" and "left" of the WebGL <a href="global.html#canvas">&lt;canvas&gt;</a> element (plus a

<li>
To determine a ship's latitude at sea without a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a>,

<p>Utah teapot.</p>

In the early years of 3D modeling and rendering, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Newell_(computer_scientist)">Martin Newel</a>
created a computer-generated three dimensional teapot.
The original <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/computer-graphics-music-and-art/15/206/556">"Utah teapot"</a>
was actually taller than the famed teapot we see in so many places today.
Legend has it that during a demo, using a system with non-square pixels, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Blinn">Jim Blinn</a>
scaled the teapot rather than scaling the image.
As this dataset became more widely distributed than the original, his edit changed the aspect of teapots in 3D software for years to come.</div>

<p>The functions in this file create models in an
<a href="https://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/c3/s4.html">IFS</a>
(Indexed Face Set) format that can be drawn using gl.drawElements
with primitive type gl.TRIANGLES.</p>

<p>Objects have vertex coordinates, normal vectors, and texture
coordinates for each vertex, plus a list of indices
for the element array buffer. </p>

The return value of each function is an object, <a href="global.html#modelData">model</a>, with properties:
<ul>
<li>model.vertexPositions -- the vertex coordinates; </li>
<li>model.vertexNormals -- the normal vectors; </li>
<li>model.vertexTextureCoords -- the texture coordinates; </li>
<li>model.indices -- the face indices. </li>
</ul>

The first three properties are of type Float32Array,
while model.indices is of type Uint16Array.

<p>This file also defines a variable (not a function) <a href="global.html#teapotModel">teapotModel</a>,
which is a model of the OpenGL

            <div class="description">Summary.

<p>The SimpleRotator class implements an <a href="/cwdc/13-webgl/extras/doc/Arcball.pdf">ArcBall</a> like interface.</p>
Created by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/profile/81100026146">Ken Shoemake</a> in 1992,
it is the de facto <a href="/cwdc/13-webgl/extras/doc/shoemake92-arcball.pdf">standard</a>
for interactive 3D model manipulation and visualization.
<p>The class defines the following methods for an object of type SimpleRotator:</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="SimpleRotator.html#setView">SimpleRotator#setView</a>(viewDirectionVector, viewUpVector, viewDistance) <br>
        set up the view, where the parameters are optional and are used in the
        same way as the corresponding parameters in the constructor;</li>
   <li><a href="SimpleRotator.html#setViewDistance">SimpleRotator#setViewDistance</a>(viewDistance)  <br>
       sets the distance of the viewer from the origin without
       changing the direction of view;</li>
   <li><a href="SimpleRotator.html#getViewDistance">SimpleRotator#getViewDistance</a>()  <br>
        returns the viewDistance;</li>
   <li><a href="SimpleRotator.html#setViewMatrix">SimpleRotator#setViewMatrix</a>(matrix) <br>
       Sets the view matrix.
   <li><a href="SimpleRotator.html#getViewMatrix">SimpleRotator#getViewMatrix</a>() <br>
       returns a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float32Array">Float32Array</a>
       representing the viewing transformation matrix for the current view, suitable for using with
       <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/uniformMatrix">gl.uniformMatrix4fv</a> <br>
       or for further transformation with the <a href="https://glmatrix.net/docs/">glmatrix</a> library
       <a href="https://glmatrix.net/docs/module-mat4.html">mat4</a> class;</li>
   <li><a href="SimpleRotator.html#getViewMatrixArray">SimpleRotator#getViewMatrixArray</a>() <br>
        returns the view transformation matrix as a regular JavaScript array,
        but still represents as a 1D array of 16 elements, in column-major order.</li>
