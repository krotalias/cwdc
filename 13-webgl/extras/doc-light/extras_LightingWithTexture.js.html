 * &lt;p>This is a &lt;b>&lt;a href="../images/mapViewer.mp4">demo&lt;/a>&lt;/b> for teaching {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics CG},
 * which became {@link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhiCFdWeQfA overly complicated},
 * and it is similar to &lt;a href="/cwdc/13-webgl/examples/lighting/content/doc-lighting2/index.html">Lighting2&lt;/a>,
 * except we define a 3x3 matrix for {@link https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Materials material properties}
 * and a 3x3 matrix for {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial/Lighting_in_WebGL light properties}
 * that are passed to the fragment shader as
 * {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/uniform uniforms}.

 * {@link https://threejs.org Three.js} only uses face normals for
 * {@link https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/PolyhedronGeometry polyhedra}, indeed.&lt;p>
 *
 * Texture coordinates can be set in each model or {@link https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/197931/how-can-i-correctly-map-a-texture-onto-a-sphere sampled at each pixel}
 * in the {@link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krotalias/cwdc/main/13-webgl/extras/LightingWithTexture.html fragment shader}.
 * We can also approximate a sphere by subdividing a
 * {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron convex regular polyhedron} and solving Mipmapping artifact issues
 * by using {@link https://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publications/2012/Tar12/jgt_tarini.pdf Tarini's} method, in this case.
 * These {@link https://bgolus.medium.com/distinctive-derivative-differences-cce38d36797b artifacts}
 * show up due to the discontinuity in the seam when crossing the line with 0 radians on one side and 2π on the other.
 * Some triangles may have edges that cross this line, causing the wrong mipmap level 0 to be chosen.
 *
 * &lt;p>To lay a map onto a sphere, textures should have an aspect ratio of 2:1 for equirectangular projections
 * or 1:1 (squared) for Mercator projections. Finding high-resolution, good-quality,
 * and free {@link https://www.axismaps.com/guide/map-projections cartographic maps}
 * is really difficult.&lt;/p>
 *
 * &lt;p>The initial position on the screen takes into account the {@link https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/earth-science/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/ obliquity}

 * will be available in the {@link readFileNames menu}. Otherwise, sorry {@link https://pages.github.com GitHub pages},
 * only the images listed in the HTML file.&lt;p>
 *
 * &lt;p>Maps are transformations from {@link module:polyhedron.cartesian2Spherical 3D space}
 * to {@link module:polyhedron.spherical2Mercator 2D space}, and they can preserve areas
 * ({@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-area_projection equal-area maps}) or angles
 * ({@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map conformal maps}). The success of the
 * {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection Mercator projection}
 * lies in its ability to preserve angles, making it ideal for navigation
 * (directions on the map match the directions on the compass). However, it distorts areas,
 * especially near the poles, where landmasses appear {@link https://math.uit.no/ansatte/dennis/MoMS2017-Lec3.pdf much larger}
 * than they are in reality. Meridian and parallel {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map) scales}
 * are the same, meaning that distances along a parallel or meridian (in fact, in all directions) are equally stretched
 * by a factor of sec(φ) = 1/cos(φ), where φ ∈ [-85.051129°, 85.051129°] is its latitude.&lt;/p>
 *
 * &lt;p>The {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection Web Mercator}
 * projection, on the other hand, is a variant of the Mercator projection, which is {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps widely}
 * used in {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_mapping web mapping} applications.
 * It was designed to work well with the Web Mercator coordinate system,
 * which is based on the {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#WGS_84 WGS 84 datum}.
 *
 * The projection is neither strictly ellipsoidal nor strictly spherical,
 * and it uses spherical development of ellipsoidal coordinates.
 * The underlying geographic coordinates are defined using the WGS 84 ellipsoidal model
 * of the Earth's surface but are projected as if
 * {@link https://alastaira.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/the-google-maps-bing-maps-spherical-mercator-projection/ defined on a sphere}.
 *
 * Misinterpreting Web Mercator for the standard Mercator during coordinate conversion can lead to
 * {@link https://web.archive.org/web/20170329065451/https://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/web_mercator/index.html deviations}
 * as much as 40 km on the ground.&lt;/p>
 *
 * &lt;p>It is impressive how {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardus_Mercator Gerardus Mercator} was able to create such a projection in a
 * {@link https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~israel/m103/mercator/mercator.html time} (1569) when there was no
 * calculus (integrals, derivatives — {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_calculus Leibniz-Newton}, 1674-1666) or even logarithm tables
 * ({@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Napier John Napier}, 1614).&lt;/p>
 *
 * {@link https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/mercator-its-not-hip-to-be-square/ Mercator texture coordinates}
 * can be set in a {@link module:polyhedron.setMercatorCoordinates model} directly or in
 * the &lt;a href="../../showCode.php?f=extras/LightingWithTexture">shader&lt;/a>
 * that samples texture coordinates for each pixel.
 *
 * Since a unit sphere fits in the WebGL {@link https://carmencincotti.com/2022-11-28/from-clip-space-to-ndc-space/ NDC space},
 * it is possible to go into each fragment from:
 * &lt;ul>
 *   &lt;li> cartesian → spherical (equirectangular) → Mercator &lt;/li>
 *   &lt;li> (x, y, z) → (long, lat) → (x, y) &lt;/li>
 *   &lt;li> sample texture at (x, y)&lt;/li>
 * &lt;/ul>
 *
 * The {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection equirectangular projection},
 * also known as the equidistant cylindrical projection (e.g., plate carrée),
 * is a way of representing the Earth's surface on a flat plane, and
 * maps longitude and latitude lines into straight, evenly spaced lines,
 * essentially flattening the sphere into a rectangle.
 *
 * &lt;p>Its meridian scale is 1 meaning that the distance along lines of longitude
 * remains the same across the map, while its parallel
 * {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map) scale} varies with latitude,
 * which means that the distance along lines of latitude is stretched by a factor of sec(φ).
 *
 * {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy Ptolemy} claims that
 * {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinus_of_Tyre Marinus of Tyre}
 * invented the projection in the first century (AD 100).
 * The projection is neither equal area nor conformal.
 * In particular, the plate carrée (&lt;em>flat square&lt;/em>) has become a standard for
 * {@link https://gisgeography.com/best-free-gis-data-sources-raster-vector/ global raster datasets}.&lt;/p>
 *
 * &lt;p>&lt;u>As a final remark&lt;/u>, I thought it would be easier to deal with map images as textures, but I was mistaken. I tried, as long as I could,
 * not to rewrite third-party code. Unfortunately, this was impossible. The main issue was that the
 * {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian prime meridian} is
 * at the center of a map image and not at its border, which corresponds to
 * its {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180th_meridian antimeridian}. &lt;/p>
 *
 * &lt;p>Initially, I used the {@link https://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/demos/script/basic-object-models-IFS.js basic-object-models-IFS} package,
 * but the models had their z-axis pointing up as the {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith zenith},
 * and I wanted the y-axis to be the north pole (up).
 * Therefore, I switched to {@link getModelData Three.js}, and almost everything
 * worked just fine. Nonetheless, a sphere created by subdividing a {@link https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/PolyhedronGeometry polyhedron}
 * had its {@link module:polyhedron.rotateUTexture texture coordinates} rotated by 180°
 * and a cylinder or cone by 90°. In fact, there is a poorly documented parameter,
 * {@link https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/ConeGeometry thetaStart}, that &lt;u>does fix&lt;/u> just that.&lt;/p>
 *
 * &lt;p>Nevertheless, I decided to adapt the {@link https://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/ hws} software
 * to my needs by introducing a global hook, {@link yNorth},
 * and {@link setNorth rotating} the models accordingly. Furthermore, I added the parameter &lt;u>stacks&lt;/u> to {@link uvCone} and {@link uvCylinder},
 * to improve interpolation and fixed the number of triangles generated in uvCone. This way, the set of models in hws and
 * three.js became quite similar, although I kept the "&lt;i>zig-zag&lt;/i>" mesh for cones and cylinders in hws
 * (I have no idea whether it provides any practical advantage).
 * A user can switch between hws and three.js models by pressing a single key (Alt, ❖ or ⌘) in the interface.&lt;/p>
 *
 * &lt;p>There is a lot of redundancy in the form of {@link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36179507/three-js-spherebuffergeometry-why-so-many-vertices vertex duplication}
 * in all of these models that precludes mipmapping artifacts.
 * The theoretical number of vertices, &lt;mark>𝑣&lt;/mark>, for a {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold manifold model}
 * and the actual number of vertices (🔴) are {@link createModel displayed} in the interface.
 * The number of edges, &lt;i>e&lt;/i>, is simply three times the number of triangles, &lt;i>t&lt;/i>, divided by two.&lt;/p>
 *
 * For any triangulation of a {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) compact surface},
 * the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/book/9780387902715">following holds&lt;/a> (page=52):
 * &lt;ul>
 * &lt;li>&lt;i>2e = 3t&lt;/i>,&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>&lt;i>e = 3(&lt;mark>𝑣&lt;/mark> - &lt;a href="../doc/Eulers_Map_Theorem.pdf">χ&lt;/a>), χ(S²)=2&lt;/i>,&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>𝑣 &amp;ge; 1/2 (7 + √(49 - 24χ)).&lt;/li>
 * &lt;/ul>
 *
 * &lt;p>As a proof of concept, I implemented a {@link uvSphereND sphere} model without any vertex duplication.
 * Besides being much harder to code, its last slice (e.g., slices = 48) goes from 6.152285613280011 (2π/48 * 47) to 0.0
 * and not 2π (if there was an extra duplicate vertex), which generates texture coordinates
 * going from 0.9791666666666666 (47/48) to 0.0 and not 1.0.
 * Although this discontinuity is what causes the mipmapping artifacts, it has nothing to do with the topology of the model
 * but how mipmapping is {@link https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems2/part-iii-high-quality-rendering/chapter-28-mipmap-level-measurement implemented} on the GPU.
 *
 * However, since an entire line is mapped onto the vextex at the north or south pole,
 * and a vertex can have only one pair of texture coordinates (u,v),
 * no matter what value we use for the "u" coordinate (e.g., 0 or 0.5),
 * the interpolation will produce an awkward swirl effect at the poles.&lt;/p>
 *
 * Of course, these are just {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh polygon meshes} suitable for visualization
 * and not valid topological {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation B-rep}
 * models that enforce the {@link https://www.britannica.com/science/Euler-characteristic Euler characteristic}
 * by using the {@link https://people.computing.clemson.edu/~dhouse/courses/405/papers/p589-baumgart.pdf winged-edge},
 * {@link https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/282918.282923 quad-edge},
 * or &lt;a href="../doc/TeseKevinWeiler.pdf">radial-edge&lt;/a> data structures required in
 * {@link https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010448596000668?via%3Dihub solid modeling}.
 *
 * &lt;p>&lt;b>The application&lt;/b>: Around The World in &lt;a href="../images/Brazil.mp4">373 historical figures&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
 * &lt;p>When I was a child and forced to study history, I was never able to visualize the actual location of an event.
 * For instance, where were the locations of Thrace, Anatolia, Troy, the Parthian Empire, the Inca Empire, and Rapa Nui?&lt;/p>
 *
 * &lt;p>Therefore, I have always wanted to present, in a graphical way, the connection between historical events in time and space.
 * I think I have been able to implement a reasonable application for doing just that. However, how I implemented it is not the main point.
 * For not using any npm packages or bundlers, I decided to stick only with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebGL,
 * plus some packages, including three.js.&lt;/p>
 *
 * &lt;p>The documentation is extensive because I aimed to use it in an introductory computer graphics course.
 * However, I have come to realize that computer graphics has become a commodity, much like database management;
 * everyone utilizes it, yet very few people are interested in understanding the underlying mechanics.
 * This trend poses a challenge for educators, as it becomes increasingly important to
 * inspire curiosity and a deeper appreciation for the artistic and technical aspects of graphics programming.
 * By focusing on foundational principles, I hope to encourage students to explore beyond the surface and engage
 * with the creative possibilities that computer graphics offers.&lt;/p>
 *
 * &lt;p>Of course, everything could have been implemented using three.js only,
 * although I am not sure OrbitControls would give me the flexibility I needed to build the interface.
 * Exploring alternative libraries and frameworks could provide additional tools and features
 * that enhance the user experience and streamline development.
 * Ultimately, the goal is to create an environment where students feel empowered to experiment and innovate,
 * pushing the boundaries of what they can achieve in graphics programming.&lt;/p>
 *
 * &lt;p>I used no AI, and for three or four months when I woke up, I picked up an event and read a lot of material, mainly Wikipedia,
 * for dating the events associated with a site. As a consequence, it is clear to me now that I know very little about Africa and Australia.
 * This realization has sparked a desire in me to delve deeper into the histories and cultures of these regions.
 * I plan to explore diverse resources, including books, documentaries, and discussions with knowledgeable individuals,
 * to gain a more comprehensive understanding of their rich narratives.&lt;/p>
 *
 * &lt;p>It is possible to cycle through the historical figures by country when
 * choosing a {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 two letter} ISO country code in the interface.
 * For example, selecting "BR" will display all the figures from
 * &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRZoIE-D2ke/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">Brazil&lt;/a>,
 * while "US" will show those from the
 * &lt;A href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRHM2NHj7O_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">United States of America&lt;/a>.
 *
 * The sorting of dates uses the day, month and year of the last date of the last entry
 * in the &lt;a href="/cwdc/13-webgl/extras/locations.json">remarkable list&lt;/a> field.
 * E.g., "The Blitz (Battle of Britain), 10 July 1940 - 11 May 1941" is sorted using "10 July 1940".&lt;/p>
 *
 * &lt;p>Dates should be preceded by a comma in the remarkable list
 * field to be considered for sorting (no error checking is done). Examples:
 * &lt;pre>
 *  , 324                       (1 0 324)
 *  , 657 BC                    (1 0 -657)
 *  , 330-1453                  (1 0 330)
 *  , 10 July 1940 - May 1941   (10 6 1940)
 *  , 15 July 1099              (15 6 1099)
 * &lt;/pre>
 * &lt;/p>
 *
 * &lt;b>Note:&lt;/b>
 * ☠ means &lt;i>&lt;a href="../images/Caribbean.mp4">Caribbean&lt;/a>&lt;/i>,
 * ⚔ (WW) means &lt;i>&lt;a href="../images/WWII.mp4">World War II&lt;/a>&lt;/i>,
 * ✝ means &lt;i>&lt;a href="../images/Crusades.mp4">Crusade&lt;/a>&lt;/i>,
 * ☢ means &lt;i>&lt;a href="../images/radiation.mp4">Radiation&lt;/a>&lt;/i>,
 * 🧪 means &lt;i>&lt;a href="../images/labs.mp4">Laboratory&lt;/a>&lt;/i>,
 * BC means &lt;i>&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRHRmcOD_KR/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">Before Christ&lt;/a>&lt;/i>

 *
 * &lt;ol>
 * &lt;li>The application displays the
 * &lt;a href="/cwdc/13-webgl/extras/locations.json">location&lt;/a> (when its name is checked in the interface)
 * of a {@link gpsCoordinates city}
 * as the intersection of its line of latitude (parallel) and line of longitude (meridian) on the model surface (preferably a map onto a sphere).
 * Your task is to pick a point in the texture image (using the mouse or any pointer device) and display its location
 * on the texture image (map) and on the 3D model.
 * &lt;ul>
 *   &lt;li>To do this, you need to convert the screen coordinates of the mouse pointer into texture coordinates (u, v), then
 *   into {@link spherical2gcs GCS} coordinates (longitude, latitude) using the {@link currentLocation}, and
 *   optionally {@link module:polyhedron.spherical2Mercator transforming} them to Mercator coordinates.&lt;/li>
 *   &lt;li>To draw the lines, use the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineTo lineTo()} from
 *       HTML5 by placing an element &amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt; on top of the element &amp;ltimg&amp;gt.&lt;/li>
 *   &lt;li>This is simple to accomplish by {@link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14824747/overlay-html5-canvas-over-image nesting}
 *       the &amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt; element with {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position position}
 *       absolute in a &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; element with position relative and the {@link newTexture same size} as the image element.&lt;/li>
 *   &lt;li>The &amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt; element should have a higher {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index z-index}
 *       than the image element and ignore
 *       {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events pointer events}.&lt;/li>
 *    &lt;li>Finally, define a {@link event:pointerdown-textimg pointerdown} event handler to set
 *        the {@link currentLocation} as the {@link gpsCoordinates} "Unknown" and draw the lines
 *        by calling {@link drawLinesOnImage} in {@link draw}.&lt;/li>
 * &lt;/ul>
 * &lt;/li>
 *
 * &lt;li>A bigger challenge would be to pick the point directly onto the model's surface, but you'll have to implement a 3D pick in this case
 *     by casting a ray, {@link unproject unprojecting} it, and finding its closest
 *     (first) intersection (relative to the viewer) with the polygonal surface of the model.&lt;/li>
 * &lt;ul>
 *  &lt;li>The easiest way is shooting the ray from the mouse position and {@link pixelRayIntersection intersecting}
 *      it against the surface of an implicit sphere
 *      by {@link lineSphereIntersection solving} a {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line–sphere_intersection second-degree equation}.&lt;/li>
 *  &lt;li>The other way is to intersect the ray against each face of the polygonal surface by testing if the ray intersects the plane
 *      of a face and then checking if the intersection point is inside the corresponding triangle.&lt;/li>
 *  &lt;li>We select a position on the globe by {@link event:pointerdown-theCanvas clicking} a mouse button in the WebGL canvas.&lt;/li>
 *  &lt;li>To display the {@link GCS} coordinates of the pointer while the globe is spinning, we need to keep track of the
 *     {@link cursorPosition cursor position}
 *     and then shoot a ray through this position to find its {@link pixelRayIntersection intersection} on the globe.&lt;/li>
 *  &lt;li>Because a {@link isTouchDevice touch device} does not have a cursor position, we can use the Phong {@link phongHighlight highlight}
 *      position on the globe as a cursor.
 *      To do this, we need to know the initial position of the highlight in world coordinates
 *      (0, 0, 1)—or in {@link GCS} coordinates (-90°, 0°)—and then transform it into {@link gcs2Screen screen coordinates}.&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>
 *  To exhibit a location name in 3D, it is necessary to {@link project transform} its
 * {@link https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/informix-servers/12.10.0?topic=data-geographic-coordinate-system GCS} coordinates
 * into {@link https://olegvaraksin.medium.com/convert-world-to-screen-coordinates-and-vice-versa-in-webgl-c1d3f2868086 screen coordinates}
 * (pixels) and use the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position position}
 * HTML properties "top" and "left" of the WebGL {@link canvas &amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;} element (plus a
 * {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tooltip_role tooltip} element) to display the text.
 * &lt;/li>
 * &lt;/ul>
 * &lt;li>
 * To determine a ship's latitude at sea without a {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System GPS},
