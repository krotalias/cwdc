Notes:

Until three@0.160.0, three.js supported UMD (Universal Module Definition).
From version @161 and beyond, three.js started to use only ESD (ES Modules),
and import should be done using importmap. The reason was to allow shipping the "addons" files.

<script type="importmap">
    {
        "imports": {
            "three": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@latest/build/three.module.js",
            "three/addons/": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@latest/examples/jsm/",
            "TextGeometry": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@latest/examples/jsm/geometries/TextGeometry.js",
            "FontLoader": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@latest/examples/jsm/loaders/FontLoader.js",
            "BufferGeometryUtils": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@latest/examples/jsm/utils/BufferGeometryUtils.js"
        }
    }
</script>

In "/cwdc/13-webgl/lib" there are the last files from version @160:
• three.js
• three.min.js
• three.module.js
• three.module.min.js

Both build files contain the same logic; it’s just exported differently.
File three.js is a UMD file, whereas three.module.js uses ES6 modules.

For this reason, we also supply file TeapotGeometry.js, which uses three.module.js
from @160 and TeapotGeometry-func.js, which is packed into a function and should be used
whenever UMD modules are needed.

Directory "three.r163" is incomplete and holds a modified version of the import of some
files (the ones I use) in the "jsm" subdirectory so that no importmap is needed.
This trick was borrowed from unpkg.com, for instance:

• examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js

import {
        EventDispatcher,
        MOUSE,
        Quaternion,
        Spherical,
        TOUCH,
        Vector2,
        Vector3,
        Plane,
        Ray,
        MathUtils
} from '/cwdc/13-webgl/lib/three.r163/build/three.module.js'; // was just 'three'

import * as THREE from "/cwdc/13-webgl/lib/three.r163/build/three.module.js";
import { VertexNormalsHelper } from "/cwdc/13-webgl/lib/three.r163/examples/jsm/helpers/VertexNormalsHelper.js";
import { OBJLoader } from "/cwdc/13-webgl/lib/three.r163/examples/jsm/loaders/OBJLoader.js";

or

import * as THREE from "https://unpkg.com/three@latest/build/three.module.js?module";
import { VertexNormalsHelper } from "https://unpkg.com/three@latest/examples/jsm/helpers/VertexNormalsHelper.js?module";
import { OBJLoader } from "https://unpkg.com/three@latest/examples/jsm/loaders/OBJLoader.js?module";
import { OBJLoader } from "https://unpkg.com/three@latest/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js?module";

Finally, directory "three" contains version @148, but as far as I remember, I am
no longer using it. It was needed to avoid the lighting context change
in version @155, when the legacy lighting mode was disabled by default. However,
I have increased all light intensities in my code, where appropriate.
