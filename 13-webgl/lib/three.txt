Notes:

Until three@0.160.0, three.js supported UMD (Universal Module Definition).
From version @161 and beyond, three.js started to use only ESD (ES Modules),
and import should be done using importmap. The reason was to allow shipping the addon files.

<script type="importmap">
    {
        "imports": {
            "three": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@latest/build/three.module.js",
            "three/addons/": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@latest/examples/jsm/",
            "TextGeometry": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@latest/examples/jsm/geometries/TextGeometry.js",
            "FontLoader": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@latest/examples/jsm/loaders/FontLoader.js",
            "BufferGeometryUtils": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@latest/examples/jsm/utils/BufferGeometryUtils.js"
        }
    }
</script>

In this directory, there are the last files from version @160:
• three.js
• three.min.js
• three.module.js
• three.module.min.js

Both build files contain the same logic; it’s just exported differently.
File three.js is a UMD file, whereas three.module.js uses ES6 modules.

For this reason, we also supply file TeapotGeometry.js, which uses three.module.js
fromm @160 and TeapotGeometry-func.js, which is packed into a funcion, and should be used
whenever UMD modules are needed.
