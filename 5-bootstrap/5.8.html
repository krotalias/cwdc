            <pre>
            So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
            Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
            A smile from a veil?
            Do you think you can tell?

            Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
            Hot ashes for trees?
            Hot air for a cool breeze?
            Cold comfort for change?
            Did you exchange
            A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

            How I wish, how I wish you were here.
            We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
            Running over the same old ground.
            What have we found?
            The same old fears.
            Wish you were here.

            <h2>Father And Son (Cat Stevens)</h2>

            <pre>
            [Father:]
            It's not time to make a change
            Just relax, take it easy
            You're still young, that's your fault
            There's so much you have to know
            Find a girl, settle down
            If you want you can marry
            Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

            I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy
            To be calm when you've found something going on
            But take your time, think a lot
            Why, think of everything you've got
            For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not

            [Son:]
            How can I try to explain, cause when I do he turns away again
            It's always been the same, same old story
            From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
            Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away
            I know I have to go

            [Father:]
            It's not time to make a change
            (Away, away, away)
            Just sit down, take it slowly
            You're still young, that's your fault
            (I know)
            There's so much you have to go through
            (I have to make this decision)
            Find a girl, settle down
            (Alone)
            If you want you can marry
            Look at me, (No) I am old, but I'm happy

            [Son:]
            All the times that I cried
            (Decision, decision, decision)
            Keeping all the things I knew inside
            It's hard (Why must)
            But it's harder to ignore it
            (You go and make this decision)
            If they were right, I'd agree
            (Alone?)
            But it's them they know not me
            Now there's a way and I know
            That I have to go away
            I know I have to go

            <h2>American Pie (Don McLean)</h2>

            <pre>
            [Intro]
            A long, long time ago
            I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
            And I knew if I had my chance
            That I could make those people dance
            And maybe they'd be happy for a while

            But February made me shiver
            With every paper I'd deliver
            Bad news on the doorstep
            I couldn't take one more step

            I can't remember if I cried
            When I read about his widowed bride
            But something touched me deep inside
            The day the music died

            [Chorus:]
            So bye, bye, Miss American Pie
            Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
            And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
            Singin' this'll be the day that I die
            This'll be the day that I die

            [Verse 1]
            Did you write the book of love
            And do you have faith in God above
            If the Bible tells you so?
            Now do you believe in rock and roll?
            Can music save your mortal soul?
            And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

            Well, I know that you're in love with him
            'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
            You both kicked off your shoes
            Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

            I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
            With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
            But I knew I was out of luck
            The day the music died

            [Chorus:]
            I started singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
            Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
            Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
            Singin' this'll be the day that I die
            This'll be the day that I die

            [Verse 2]
            Now for ten years we've been on our own
            And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
            But that's not how it used to be
            When the jester sang for the king and queen
            In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
            And a voice that came from you and me

            Oh, and while the king was looking down
            The jester stole his thorny crown
            The courtroom was adjourned
            No verdict was returned

            And while Lenin read a book on Marx
            The quartet practiced in the park
            And we sang dirges in the dark
            The day the music died

            [Chorus:]
            We were singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
            Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
            Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
            Singin' this'll be the day that I die
            This'll be the day that I die

            [Verse 3]
            Helter skelter in a summer swelter
            The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
            Eight miles high and falling fast
            It landed foul on the grass
            The players tried for a forward pass
            With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

            Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
            While the sergeants played a marching tune
            We all got up to dance
            Oh, but we never got the chance

            'Cause the players tried to take the field
            The marching band refused to yield
            Do you recall what was revealed
            The day the music died?

            [Chorus:]
            We started singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
            Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
            Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
            And singin' this'll be the day that I die
            This'll be the day that I die

            [Verse 4]
            Oh, and there we were all in one place
            A generation lost in space
            With no time left to start again
            So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
            Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
            'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

            Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
            My hands were clenched in fists of rage
            No angel born in Hell
            Could break that Satan's spell

            And as the flames climbed high into the night
            To light the sacrificial rite
            I saw Satan laughing with delight
            The day the music died

            [Chorus:]
            He was singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
            Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
            Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
            And singin' this'll be the day that I die
            This'll be the day that I die

            [Outro]
            I met a girl who sang the blues
            And I asked her for some happy news
            But she just smiled and turned away
            I went down to the sacred store
            Where I'd heard the music years before
            But the man there said the music wouldn't play

            And in the streets, the children screamed
            The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
            But not a word was spoken
            The church bells all were broken

            And the three men I admire most
            The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
            They caught the last train for the coast
            The day the music died

            [Chorus:]
            And they were singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
            Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
            And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
            Singin' this'll be the day that I die
            This'll be the day that I die

            [Chorus:]
            They were singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
            Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
            Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
            And singin' this'll be the day that I die
