                The basic Thach Weave, executed by two wingmen.
            </p>

            <p class="justified">
                It is a tactical formation maneuver in which two or more allied
                planes would weave in regularly intersecting flight paths to
                lure an enemy into focusing on one plane, while the targeted
                pilot's wingman would come into position to attack the
                pursuer.<br /><br />

                Working at night with matchsticks on the table, he eventually
                came up with what he called "Beam Defense Position", but which
                soon became known as the "Thach Weave". It was executed either
                by two fighter aircraft side-by-side or by two pairs of fighters
                flying together. When an enemy aircraft chose one fighter as his
                target (the "bait" fighter; his wingman being the "hook"), the
                two wingmen turned in towards each other. After crossing paths,
                and once their separation was great enough, they would then
                repeat the exercise, again turning in towards each other,
                bringing the enemy plane into the hook's sights. A correctly
                executed Thach Weave (assuming the bait was taken and followed)
                left little chance of escape to even the most maneuverable
                opponent. <br /><br />

                Thach called on Ensign Edward "Butch" O'Hare, who led the second
                section in Thach's division, to test the idea. Thach took off
                with three other Wildcats in the role of defenders, O'Hare
                meanwhile led four Wildcats in the role of attackers. The
                defending aircraft had their throttles wired (to restrict their
                performance), while the attacking aircraft had their engine
                power unrestricted - this simulated an attack by superior
                fighter aircraft. <br /><br />

                Trying a series of mock attacks, O'Hare found that in every
                instance Thach's fighters, despite their power handicap, had
                either ruined his attack or actually maneuvered into position to
                shoot back. After landing, O'Hare excitedly congratulated Thach:
                "Skipper, it really worked. I couldn't make any attack without
                seeing the nose of one of your airplanes pointed at me."
                <br /><br />

                The maneuver proved so effective that American pilots also used
                it during the Vietnam War, and it remains an applicable
                dogfighting tactic today.<br /><br />

                They don't send one fighter out alone, they always send them in
                pairs.
